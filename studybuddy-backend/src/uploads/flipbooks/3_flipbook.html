Preface
Broadly sp eaking, y ou can divide the history of computers in to four p erio ds: the mainframe, the
mini, the micropro cessor, and the mo dern p ost-micropro cessor. The mainfr ame era w as c harac-
terized b y computers that required large buildings and teams of tec hnicians and op erators to k eep
them going. More often than not, b oth academics and studen ts had little direct con tact with the
mainframey ou handed a dec k of punc hed cards to an op erator and w aited for the output to ap-
p ear hours later. During the mainfame era, academics concen trated on languages and compilers,
algorithms, and op erating systems.
The minic omputer era put computers in the hands of studen ts and academics, b ecause univ ersit y
departmen ts could no w buy their o wn minis. As minicomputers w ere not as complex as main-
frames and b ecause studen ts could get direct hands-on exp erience, man y departmen ts of computer
science and electronic engineering taugh t studen ts ho w to program in the nativ e language of the
computerassem bly language. In those da ys, the mid 1970s, assem bly language programming
w as used to teac h b oth the con trol of I/O devices, and the writing of programs (i.e., assem bly
language w as taugh t rather lik e high lev el languages). The explosion of computer soft w are had
not tak en place, and if y ou w an ted soft w are y ou had to write it y ourself.
The late 1970s sa w the in tro duction of the micr opr o c essor . F or the rst time, eac h studen t w as
able to access a real computer. Unfortunately , micropro cessors app eared b efore the in tro duction
of lo w-cost memory (b oth primary and secondary). Studen ts had to program micropro cessors
in assem bly language b ecause the only storage mec hanism w as often a R OM with just enough
capacit y to hold a simple single-pass assem bler.
The adv en t of the lo w-cost micropro cessor system (usually on a single b oard) ensured that virtually
ev ery studen t to ok a course on assem bly language. Ev en to da y , most courses in computer science
include a mo dule on computer arc hitecture and organization, and teac hing studen ts to write
programs in assem bly language forces them to understand the computer's arc hitecture. Ho w ev er,
some computer scien tists who had b een educated during the mainframe era w ere unhapp y with
the micropro cessor, b ecause they felt that the 8-bit micropro cessor w as a retrograde stepits
arc hitecture w as far more primitiv e than the mainframes they had studied in the 1960s.
The 1990s is the p ost-micr opr o c essor era. T o da y's p ersonal computers ha v e more p o w er and
storage capacit y than man y of y esterda y's mainframes, and they ha v e a range of p o w erful soft w are
to ols that w ere undreamed of in the 1970s. Moreo v er, the computer science curriculum of the
1990s has explo ded. In 1970 a studen t could b e exp ected to b e familiar with all eld of computer
science. T o da y , a studen t can b e exp ected only to bro wse through the highligh ts.
The a v ailabilit y of high-p erformance hardw are and the driv e to include more and more new ma-
terial in the curriculum, has put pressure on academics to justify what they teac h. In particular,
man y are questioning the need for courses on assem bly language.
If y ou regard computer science as b eing primarily concerned with the use of the computer, y ou
can argue that assem bly language is an irrelev ance. Do es the surgeon study metallurgy in order
to understand ho w a scalp el op erates? Do es the pilot study thermo dynamics to understand ho w
a jet engine op erates? Do es the news reader study electronics to understand ho w the camera

op erates? The answ er to all these questions is  no . So wh y should w e inict assem bly language
and computer arc hitecture on the studen t?
First, e duc ation is not the same as tr aining . The studen t of computer science is not simply b eing
trained to use a n um b er of computer pac k ages. A univ ersit y course leading to a degree should
also co v er the history and the the or etic al b asis for the sub ject. Without a kno wledge of computer
arc hitecture, the computer scien tist cannot understand ho w computers ha v e dev elop ed and what
they are capable of.
Is assem bly language to da y the same as assem bly language y esterda y?
T w o factors ha v e inuenced the w a y in whic h w e teac h assem bly languageone is the w a y in whic h
micropro cessors ha v e c hanged, and the other is the use to whic h assem bly language teac hing is
put. Ov er the y ears micropro cessors ha v e b ecome more and more complex, with the result that
the arc hitecture and assem bly language of a mo dern state-of-the-art micropro cessor is radically
dieren t to that of an 8-bit mac hine of the late 1970s. When w e rst taugh t assem bly language in
the 1970s and early 1980s, w e did it to demonstrate ho w computers op erated and to giv e studen ts
hands-on exp erience of a computer. Since all studen ts either ha v e their o wn computer or ha v e ac-
cess to a computer lab, this role of the single-b oard computer is no w obsolete. Moreo v er, assem bly
language programming once attempted to ap e high-lev el language programming studen ts w ere
taugh t algorithms suc h as sorting and searc hing in assem bly language, as if assem bly language
w ere no more than the (desp erately) p o or p erson's C.
The argumen t for teac hing assem bly language programming to da y can b e divided in to t w o com-
p onen ts: the underpinning of computer arc hitecture and the underpinning of computer soft w are.
Assem bly language teac hes ho w a computer w orks at the mac hine (i.e., register) lev el. It is there-
fore necessary to teac h assem bly language to all those who migh t later b e in v olv ed in computer
arc hitectureeither b y sp ecifying computers for a particular application, or b y designing new
arc hitectures. Moreo v er, the v on Neumann mac hine's sequen tial nature teac hes studen ts the limi-
tation of con v en tional arc hitectures and, indirectly , leads them on to uncon v en tional arc hitectures
(parallel pro cessors, Harv ard arc hitectures, data o w computers, and ev en neural net w orks).
It is probably in the realm of soft w are that y ou can most easily build a case for the teac hing of
assem bly language. During a studen t's career, he or she will encoun ter a lot of abstr act concepts in
sub jects ranging from programming languages, to op erating systems, to real-time programming,
to AI. The foundation of man y of these concepts lies in assem bly language programming and
computer arc hitecture. Y ou migh t ev en sa y that assem bly language pro vides b ottom-up supp ort
for the top-down metho dology w e teac h in high-lev el languages. Consider some of the follo wing
examples (tak en from the teac hing of A dv anced RISC Mac hines Ltd (ARM) assem bly language).
Data t yp es
Studen ts come across data t yp es in high-lev el languages and the eects of strong and w eak
data t yping. T eac hing an assem bly language that can op erate on bit, b yte, w ord and long
w ord op erands helps studen ts understand data t yp es. Moreo v er, the abilit y to p erform an y
t yp e of assem bly language op eration on an y t yp e of data structure demonstrates the need
for strong t yping.
A ddressing mo des
A vital comp onen t of assem bly language teac hing is addressing mo des (literal, direct, and
indirect). The studen t learns ho w p oin ters function and ho w p oin ters are manipulated. This
asp ect is particularly imp ortan t if the studen t is to b ecome a C programmer. Because an
assem bly language is unencum b ered b y data t yp es, the studen ts' view of p oin ters is m uc h
simplied b y an assem bly language. The ARM has complex addressing mo des that supp ort
direct and indirect addressing, generated jump tables and handling of unkno wn memory
osets.

The stac k and subroutines
Ho w pro cedures are called, and parameters passed and returned from pro cedures. By using
an assem bly language y ou can readily teac h the passing of parameters b y value and b y
r efer enc e . The use of lo c al variables and r e-entr ant programming can also b e taugh t. This
supp orts the teac hing of task switc hing k ernels in b oth op erating systems and real-time
programming.
Recursion
The recursiv e calling of subroutines often causes a studen t problems. Y ou can use an assem-
bly language, together with a suitable system with a tracing facilit y , to demonstrate ho w
recursion op erates. The studen t can actually observ e ho w the stac k gro ws as pro cedures are
called.
Run-time supp ort for high-lev el languages
A high-p erformance pro cessor lik e the ARM pro vides facilities that supp ort run-time c hec k-
ing in high-lev el languages. F or example, the programming tec hniques do cumen t lists a
series of programs that in terface with 'C' and pro vide run-time c hec king for errors suc h as
an attempt to divide a n um b er b y zero.
Protected-mo de op eration
Mem b ers of the ARM family op erate in either a privile dge mo de or a user mo de . The
op erating system op erates in the priviledge mo de and all user (applications) programs run in
the user mo de. This mec hanism can b e used to construct se cur e or pr ote cte d en vironmen ts in
whic h the eects of an error in one application can b e prev en ted from harming the op erating
system (or other applications).
Input-output
Man y high-lev el languages mak e it dicult to access I/O p orts and devices directly . By
using an assem bly language w e can teac h studen ts ho w to write device driv ers and ho w to
con trol in terfaces. Most real in terfaces are still programmed at the mac hine lev el b y accessing
registers within them.
All these topics can, of course, b e taugh t in the appropriate courses (e.g., high-lev el languages,
op erating systems). Ho w ev er, b y teac hing them in an assem bly language course, they pa v e the
w a y for future studies, and also sho w the studen t exactly what is happ ening within the mac hine.
Conclusion
A strong case can b e made for the con tin ued teac hing of assem bly language within the computer
science curriculum. Ho w ev er, an assem bly language cannot b e taugh t just as if it w ere another
general-purp ose programming language as it w as once taugh t ten y ears ago. P erhaps more than
an y other comp onen t of the computer science curriculum, teac hing an assem bly language supp orts
a wide range of topics at the heart of computer science. An assem bly language should not b e used
just to illustrate algorithms, but to demonstrate what is actually happ ening inside the computer.

1Introduction
A computer program is ultimately a series of n um b ers and therefore has v ery little meaning to a
h uman b eing. In this c hapter w e will discuss the lev els of h uman-lik e language in whic h a computer
program ma y b e expressed. W e will also discuss the reasons for and uses of assem bly language.
1.1 The Meaning of Instructions
The instruction set of a micropro cessor is the set of binary inputs that pro duce dened actions
during an instruction cycle. An instruction set is to a micropro cessor what a function table is to a
logic device suc h as a gate, adder, or shift register. Of course, the actions that the micropro cessor
p erforms in resp onse to its instruction inputs are far more complex than the actions that logic
devices p erform in resp onse to their inputs.
1.1.1 Binary Instructions
An instruction is a binary digit pattern  it m ust b e a v ailable at the data inputs to the micropro-
cessor at the prop er time in order to b e in terpreted as an instruction. F or example, when the ARM
receiv es the binary pattern 111000000100 as the input during an instruction fetc h op eration, the
pattern means subtract. Similary the microinstruction 111000001000 means add. Th us the 32
bit pattern 11100000010011101100000000001111 means:
 Subtr act R15 fr om R14 and put the answer in R12. 
The micropro cessor (lik e an y other computer) only recognises binary patterns as instructions or
data; it do es not recognise c haracters or o ctal, decimal, or hexadecimal n um b ers.
1.2 A Computer Program
A program is a series of instructions that causes a computer to p erform a particular task.
A ctually , a computer program includes more than instructions, it also con tains the data and the
memory addresses that the micropro cessor needs to accomplish the tasks dened b y the instruc-
tions. Clearly , if the micropro cessor is to p erform an addition, it m ust ha v e t w o n um b ers to add
and a place to put the result. The computer program m ust determine the sources of the data and
the destination of the result as w ell as the op eration to b e p erformed.
All micropro cessors execute instructions sequen tially unless an instruction c hanges the order of
execution or halts the pro cessor. That is, the pro cessor gets its next instruction from the next
higher memory address unless the curren t instruction sp ecically directs it to do otherwise.
Ultimately , ev ery program is a set of binary n um b ers. F or example, this is a snipp et of an ARM
program that adds the con ten ts of memory lo cations 8094 32 and8098 32 and places the result in
memory lo cation 809C32 :

11100101100011110101000000001000
This is a mac hine language, or ob ject, program. If this program w ere en tered in to the memory of
an ARM-based micro computer, the micro computer w ould b e able to execute it directly .
1.3 The Binary Programming Problem
There are man y diculties asso ciated with creating programs as ob ject, or binary mac hine lan-
guage, programs. These are some of the problems:
• The programs are dicult to understand or debug. (Binary n um b ers all lo ok the same,
particularly after y ou ha v e lo ok ed at them for a few hours.)
• The programs do not describ e the task whic h y ou w an t the computer to p erform in an ything
resem bling a h uman-readable format.
• The programs are long and tiresome to write.
• The programmer often mak es careless errors that are v ery dicult to lo cate and correct.
F or example, the follo wing v ersion of the addition ob ject program con tains a single bit error. T ry
to nd it:
11100101100111110001000000010000
11100101100111110001000000001000
11100000100000010101000000000000
11100110100011110101000000001000
Although the computer handles binary n um b ers with ease, p eople do not. P eople nd binary
programs long, tiresome, confusing, and meaningless. Ev en tually , a programmer ma y start re-
mem b ering some of the binary co des, but suc h eort should b e sp en t more pro ductiv ely .
1.4 Using Octal or Hexadecimal
W e can impro v e the situation somewhat b y writing instructions using o ctal or hexadecimal n um-
b ers, rather than binary . W e will use hexadecimal n um b ers b ecause they are shorter, and b ecause
they are the standard for the micropro cessor industry . T able 1.1 denes the hexadecimal digits
and their binary equiv alen ts. The ARM program to add t w o n um b ers no w b ecomes:
E59F1010
E59f0008
E0815000
E58F5008
A t the v ery least, the hexadecimal v ersion is shorter to write and not quite so tiring to examine.
Errors are somewhat easier to nd in a sequence of hexadecimal digits. The erroneous v ersion of
the addition program, in hexadecimal form, b ecomes:

E59F1010
E59f0008
E0815000
E68F5008
The mistak e is far more ob vious.
The hexadecimal v ersion of the program is still dicult to read or understand; for example, it
do es not distinguish op erations from data or addresses, nor do es the program listing pro vide an y
suggestion as to what the program do es. What do es 3038 or 31C0 mean? Memorising a card full
of co des is hardly an app etising prop osition. F urthermore, the co des will b e en tirely dieren t for
a dieren t micropro cessor and the program will require a large amoun t of do cumen tation.
1.5 Instruction Co de Mnemonics
An ob vious programming impro v emen t is to assign a name to eac h instruction co de. The instruc-
tion co de name is called a  mnemonic  or memory jogger.
In fact, all micropro cessor man ufacturers pro vide a set of mnemonics for the micropro cessor in-
struction set (they cannot remem b er hexadecimal co des either). Y ou do not ha v e to abide b y the
man ufacturer's mnemonics; there is nothing sacred ab out them. Ho w ev er, they are standard for
a giv en micropro cessor, and therefore understo o d b y all users. These are the instruction co des
that y ou will nd in man uals, cards, b o oks, articles, and programs. The problem with selecting
instruction mnemonics is that not all instructions ha v e ob vious names. Some instructions do
(for example, ADD , AND , ORR ), others ha v e ob vious con tractions (suc h as SUB for subtraction, EOR
for exclusiv e-OR), while still others ha v e neither. The result is suc h mnemonics as BIC , STMIA ,
and ev en MRS . Most man ufacturers come up with some reasonable names and some hop eless ones.
Ho w ev er, users who devise their o wn mnemonics rarely do m uc h b etter.
Along with the instruction mnemonics, the man ufacturer will usually assign names to the CPU
registers. As with the instruction names, some register names are ob vious (suc h as A for A ccum u-
lator) while others ma y ha v e only historical signicance. Again, w e will use the man ufacturer's
suggestions simply to promote standardisation.
If w e use standard ARM instruction and register mnemonics, as dened b y A dv anced RISC Ma-
c hines, our ARM addition program b ecomes:
4 CHAPTER 1. INTR ODUCTION
LDR R1, num1
LDR R0, num2
ADD R5, R1, R0
STR R5, num3
The program is still far from ob vious, but at least some parts are comprehensible. ADD is a
considerable impro v emen t o v er E59F . The LDR mnemonic do es suggest loading data in to a register
or memory lo cation. W e no w see that some parts of the program are op erations and others are
addresses. Suc h a program is an assem bly language program.
1.6 The Assem bler Program
Ho w do w e get the assem bly language program in to the computer? W e ha v e to translate it, either
in to hexadecimal or in to binary n um b ers. Y ou can translate an assem bly language program b y
hand, instruction b y instruction. This is called hand assem bly .
The follo wing table illustrates the hand assem bly of the addition program:
Instruction Mnemonic Register/Memory Lo cation Hexadecimal Equiv alen t
LDR R1, num1 E59F1010
LDR R0, num2 E59F0008
ADD R5, R1, R0 E0815000
STR R5, num3 E58F5008
Hand assem bly is a rote task whic h is unin teresting, rep etitiv e, and sub ject to n umerous minor
errors. Pic king the wrong line, transp osing digits, omitting instructions, and misreading the co des
are only a few of the mistak es that y ou ma y mak e. Most micropro cessors complicate the task ev en
further b y ha ving instructions with dieren t lengths. Some instructions are one w ord long while
others ma y b e t w o or three. Some instructions require data in the second and third w ords; others
require memory addresses, register n um b ers, or who kno ws what?
Assem bly is a rote task that w e can assign to the micro computer. The micro computer nev er
mak es an y mistak es when translating co des; it alw a ys kno ws ho w man y w ords and what format
eac h instruction requires. The program that do es this job is an  assembler . The assem bler
program translates a user program, or source program written with mnemonics, in to a mac hine
language program, or ob ject program, whic h the micro computer can execute. The assem bler's
input is a source program and its output is an ob ject program.
Assem blers ha v e their o wn rules that y ou m ust learn. These include the use of certain mark ers
(suc h as spaces, commas, semicolons, or colons) in appropriate places, correct sp elling, the prop er
con trol of information, and p erhaps ev en the correct placemen t of names and n um b ers. These
rules are usually simple and can b e learned quic kly .
1.6.1 A dditional F eatures of Assem blers
Early assem blers did little more than translate the mnemonic names of instructions and registers
in to their binary equiv alen ts. Ho w ev er, most assem blers no w pro vide suc h additional features as:
• Allo wing the user to assign names to memory lo cations, input and output devices, and ev en
sequences of instructions
• Con v erting data or addresses from v arious n um b er systems (for example, decimal or hex-
adecimal) to binary and con v erting c haracters in to their ASCI I or EBCDIC binary co des
1.7. DISAD V ANT A GES OF ASSEMBL Y LANGUA GE 5
• P erforming some arithmetic as part of the assem bly pro cess
• T elling the loader program where in memory parts of the program or data should b e placed
• Allo wing the user to assign areas of memory as temp orary data storage and to place xed
data in areas of program memory
• Pro viding the information required to include standard programs from program libraries, or
programs written at some other time, in the curren t program
• Allo wing the user to con trol the format of the program listing and the input and output
devices emplo y ed
1.6.2 Cho osing an Assem bler
All of these features, of course, in v olv e additional cost and memory . Micro computers generally
ha v e m uc h simpler assem blers than do larger computers, but the tendency is alw a ys for the size of
assem blers to increase. Y ou will often ha v e a c hoice of assem blers. The imp ortan t criterion is not
ho w man y o-b eat features the assem bler has, but rather ho w con v enien t it is to use in normal
practice.
1.7 Disadv an tages of Assem bly Language
The assem bler do es not solv e all the problems of programming. One problem is the tremendous gap
b et w een the micro computer instruction set and the tasks whic h the micro computer is to p erform.
Computer instructions tend to do things lik e add the con ten ts of t w o registers, shift the con ten ts
of the A ccum ulator one bit, or place a new v alue in the Program Coun ter. On the other hand, a
user generally w an ts a micro computer to do something lik e prin t a n um b er, lo ok for and react to
a particular command from a telet yp ewriter, or activ ate a rela y at the prop er time. An assem bly
language programmer m ust translate suc h tasks in to a sequence of simple computer instructions.
The translation can b e a dicult, time-consuming job.
F urthermore, if y ou are programming in assem bly language, y ou m ust ha v e detailed kno wledge of
the particular micro computer that y ou are using. Y ou m ust kno w what registers and instructions
the micro computers has, precisely ho w the instructions aect the v arious registers, what addressing
metho ds the computer uses, and a mass of other information. None of this information is relev an t
to the task whic h the micro computer m ust ultimately p erform.
In addition, assem bly language programs are not p ortable. Eac h micro computer has its o wn
assem bly language whic h reects its o wn arc hitecture. An assem bly language program written for
the ARM will not run on a 486, P en tium, or Z8000 micropro cessor. F or example, the addition
program written for the Z8000 w ould b e:
LD R0,%6000
ADD R0,%6002
LD %6004,R0
The lac k of p ortabilit y not only means that y ou will not b e able to use y our assem bly language
program on a dieren t micro computer, but also that y ou will not b e able to use an y programs that
w ere not sp ecically written for the micro computer y ou are using. This is a particular dra wbac k
for new micro computers, since few assem bly language programs exist for them. The result, to o
frequen tly , is that y ou are on y our o wn. If y ou need a program to p erform a particular task, y ou
are not lik ely to nd it in the small program libraries that most man ufacturers pro vide. Nor are
y ou lik ely to nd it in an arc hiv e, journal article, or someone's old program File. Y ou will probably
ha v e to write it y ourself.
6 CHAPTER 1. INTR ODUCTION
1.8 High-Lev el Languages
The solution to man y of the diculties asso ciated with assem bly language programs is to use,
insted, high-level or pr o c e dur e-oriente d langauges. Suc h languages allo w y ou to describ e tasks in
forms that are problem-orien ted rather than computer-orien ted. Eac h statemen t in a high-lev el
language p erforms a recognisable function; it will generally corresp ond to man y assem bly language
instruction. A program called a compiler translates the high-lev el language source program in to
ob ject co de or mac hine language instructions.
Man y dieren t hgih-lev el languages exist for dieren t t yp es of tasks. If, for examp e, y ou can
express what y ou w an t the computer to do in algebraic notation, y ou can write y our F ORTRAN
( F or m ula T r an slation Language), the oldest of the high-lev el languages. No w, if y ou w an t to add
t w o n um b ers, y ou just tell the computer:
sum = num1 + num2;
That is a lot simpler (and shorter) than either the equiv alen t mac hine language program or the
equiv alen t assem bly language program. Other high-lev el languages include COBOL (for business
applications), BASIC (a cut do wn v ersion of F ORTRAN designed to protot yp e ideas b efore co deing
them in full), C (a systems-programming language), C++ and JA V A (ob ject-orien tated general
dev elopmen t languages).
1.8.1 A dv an tages of High-Lev el Languages
Clearly , high-lev el languages mak e program easier and faster to write. A common estimate is
that a programmer can write a program ab out ten times as fast in a high-lev el langauge as in
assem bly language. That is just writing the program; it do es not include problem denition,
program design, debugging testing or do cumen tation, all of whic h b ecome simpler and faster. The
high-lev el language program is, for instance, partly self-do cumen ting. Ev en if y ou do not kno w
F ORTRAN , y ou could probably tell what the statemen t illustrated ab o v e do es.
Mac hine Indep endence
High-lev el languages solv e man y other problems asso ciated with assem bly language programming.
The high-lev el language has its o wn syn tax (usually dened b y an in ternational standard). The
language do es not men tion the instruction set, registers, or other features of a particular computer.
The compiler tak es care of all suc h details. Programmers can concen trate on their o wn tasks; they
do not need a detailed understanding of the underlying CPU arc hitecture  for that matter, they
do not need to kno w an ything ab out the computer the are programming.
P ortabilit y
Programs written in a high-lev el language are p ortable  at least, in theory . They will run on
an y computer that has a standard compiler for that language.
A t the same time, all previous programs written in a high-lev el language for prior computers and
a v ailable to y ou when programming a new computer. This can mean thousands of programs in
the case of a common language lik e C .
1.8. HIGH-LEVEL LANGUA GES 7
1.8.2 Disadv an tages of High-Lev el Languages
If all the go o d things w e ha v e said ab out high-lev el languages are true  if y ou can write programs
faster and mak e them p ortable b esides  wh y b other with assebly languages? Who w an ts to
w orry ab out registers, instruction co des, mnemonics, and all that garbage! As usual, there are
disadv an tages that balance the adv an tages.
Syn tax
One ob vious problem is that, as with assem bly language, y ou ha v e to learn the rules or syntax
of an y high-lev el language y ou w an t to use. A high-lev el langauge has a fairly complicated set of
rules. Y ou will nd that it tak es a lot of time just to get a program that is syn tactically correct
(and ev en then it probably will not do what y ou w an t). A high-lev el computer language is lik e
a foreign language. If y ou ha v e talen t, y ou will get used to the rules and b e able to turn out
programs that the compiler will accept. Still, learning the rules and trying to get the program
accepted b y the compiler do es not con tribute directly to doing y our job.
Cost of Compilers
Another ob vious problem is that y ou need a compiler to translate program written in a high-lev el
language in to mac hine language. Compilers are exp ensiv e and use a large amoun t of memory .
While most assem blers o ccup y only a few KBytes of memory , compilers w ould o ccup y far larger
amoun ts of memory . A compiler could easily require o v er four times as m uc h memory as an
assem bler. So the amoun t of o v erhead in v olv ed in using the compiler is rather large.
A dapting T asks to a Language
F urthermore, only some compilers will mak e the implemen tation of y our task simpler. Eac h
language has its o wn target proglem area, for example, F ORTRAN is w ell-suited to problems
that can b e expressed as algebraic form ulas. If ho w ev er, y our problem is con trolling a displa y
terminal, editing a string of c haracters, or monitoring an alarm system, y our problem cannot
b e easily expressed. In fact, form ulating the solution in F ORTRAN ma y b e more a wkw ard and
more dicult than form ulating it in assem bly language. The answ er is, of course, to use a more
suitable high-lev el language. Languages sp ecically designed for tasks suc h as those men tioned
ab o v e do exist  they are called system implemen tation languages. Ho w ev er, these languages are
less widely used.
Ineciency
High-lev el languages do not pro duce v ery ecien t mac hine language program. The basic reason
for this is that compilation is an automatic pro cess whic h is riddled with compromises to allo w for
man y ranges of p ossibilities. The compiler w orks m uc h lik e a computerised language translator 
sometimes the w ords are righ t but the sen tence structures are a wkw ard. A simpler compiler connot
kno w when a v ariable is no longer b eing used and can b e discarded, when a register should b e
used rather than a memory lo cation, or when v ariables ha v e simple relationships. The exp erienced
programmer can tak e adv an tage of shortcuts to shorten execution time or reduce memory usage.
A few compiler (kno wn as optimizing cmpilers) can also do this, but suc h compilers are m uc h
larger than regular compilers.

1.9 Whic h Lev el Should Y ou Use?
Whic h language lev el y ou use dep ends on y our particulr application. Let us briey note some of
the factors whic h ma y fa v or particular lev els:
1.9.1 Applications for Mac hine Language
Virtually no one programs in mac hine language b ecause it w astes h uman time and is dicult to
do cumen t. An assem bler costs v ery little and greatly reduces programming time.
1.9.2 Applications for Assem bly Language
• Limited data pro cessing • Short to mo derate-sized programs
• High-v olume applications • Application where memory cost is a factor
• Real-Time con trol applications • Applications in v olving more input/output
or con trol than computation
1.9.3 Applications for High-Lev el Language
• Long programs • Compatibilit y with similar applications
using larger computers
• Lo w-v olume applications • Applications in v oling more computation
than input/output or con trol
• Programs whic h are exp ected • Applications where the amout of memory
to undergo man y c hanges required is already v ery large
• A v ailabilit y of a sp ecic program in a high-lev el language whic h can b e used
in the application.
1.9.4 Other Considerations
Man y other factors are also imp ortan t, suc h as the a v ailabilit y of a large computer for use in
dev elopmen t, exp erience with particular languages, and compatibilit y with other applications.
If hardw are will ultimately b e the largest cost in y our application, or if sp eed is critical, y ou should
fa v or assem bly language. But b e prepared to sp end m uc h extra time in soft w are dev elopmen t in
exc hange for lo w er memory costs and higher execution sp eeds. If soft w are will b e the largest cost
in y our application, y ou should fa v or a high-lev el language. But b e prepared to sp end the extra
money required for the supp orting hardw are and soft w are.
Of course, no one except some theorists will ob ject if y ou use b oth assem bly and high-lev el lan-
guages. Y ou can write the program originally in a high-lev el language and then patc h some sections
in assem bly language. Ho w ev er, most users prefer not to do this b ecause it can create ha v o c in
debugging, testing, and do cumen tation.
1.10 Wh y Learn Assem bler?
Giv en the adv ance of high-lev el languages, wh y do y ou need to learn assem bly language program-
ming? The reasons are:
1.10. WHY LEARN ASSEMBLER? 9
1. Most industrial micro computer users program in assem bly language.
2. Man y micro computer users will con tin ue to program in assem bly language since they need
the detailed con trol that it pro vides.
3. No suitable high-lev el language has y et b ecome widely a v ailable or standardised.
4. Man y application require the eciency of assem bly language.
5. An understanding of assem bly language can help in ev aluating high-lev el languages.
6. Almost all micro computer programmers ultimately nd that they need some kno wledge of
assem bly language, most often to debug programs, write I/O routines, sp eed up or shorten
critical sections of programs written in high-lev el languages, utilize or mo dify op erating
system functions, and undertand other p eople's programs.
The rest of these notes will deal exclusiv ely with assem bler and assem bly language programming.

2Assemblers
This c hapter discusses the functions p erformed b y assem blers, b eginning with features common
to most assem blers and pro ceeding through more elab orate capabilities suc h as macros and con-
ditional assem bly . Y ou ma y wish to skim this c hapter for the presen t and return to it when y ou
feel more comfortable with the material.
As w e men tioned, to da y's assem blers do m uc h more than translate assem bly language mnemonics
in to binary co des. But w e will describ e ho w an assem bler handles the translation of mnemonics
b efore describing additional assem bler features. Finally w e will explain ho w assem blers are used.
2.1 Fields
Assem bly language instructions (or statemen ts) are divided in to a n um b er of  elds .
The op eration co de eld is the only eld whic h can nev er he empt y; it alw a ys con tains either an
instruction mnemonic or a directiv e to the assem bler, sometimes called a pseudo-instruction,
pseudo-op eration, or pseudo-op.
The op erand or address eld ma y con tain an address or data, or it ma y b e blank.
The commen t and lab el elds are optional. A programmer will assign a lab el to a statemen t or
add a commen t as a p ersonal con v enience: namely , to mak e the program easier to read and use.
Of course, the assem bler m ust ha v e some w a y of telling where one eld ends and another b egins.
Assem blers often require that eac h eld start in a sp ecic column. This is a xed format.
Ho w ev er, xed formats are incon v enien t when the input medium is pap er tap e; xed formats are
also a n uisance to programmers. The alternativ e is a free format where the elds ma y app ear
an ywhere on the line.
2.1.1 Delimiters
If the assem bler cannot use the p osition on the line to tell the elds apart, it m ust use something
else. Most assem blers use a sp ecial sym b ol or delimiter at the b eginning or end of eac h eld.

question marks, and other c haracters that w ould not otherwise b e used in assem bly language
programs also ma y serv e as delimiters. The general form of la y out for the ARM assem bler is:
Y ou will ha v e to exercise a little care with delimiters. Some assem blers are fussy ab out extra spaces
or the app earance of delimiters in commen ts or lab els. A w ell-written assem bler will handle these
minor problems, but man y assem blers are not w ell-written. Our recommendation is simple: a v oid
p oten tial problems if y ou can. The follo wing rules will help:
• Do not use extra spaces, in particular, do not put spaces after commas that separate
op erands, ev en though the ARM assem bler allo ws y ou to do this.
• Do not use delimiter c haracters in names or lab els.
• Include standard delimiters ev en if y our assem bler do es not require them. Then it will b e
more lik ely that y our programs are in correct form for another assem bler.
2.1.2 Lab els
The lab el eld is the rst eld in an assem bly language instruction; it ma y b e blank. If a lab el
is presen t, the assem bler denes the lab el as equiv alen t to the address in to whic h the rst b yte
of the ob ject co de generated for that instruction will b e loaded. Y ou ma y subsequen tly use the
lab el as an address or as data in another instruction's address eld. The assem bler will replace
the lab el with the assigned v alue when creating an ob ject program.
The ARM assem bler requires lab els to start at the rst c haracter of a line. Ho w ev er, some other
assem blers also allo w y ou to ha v e the lab el start an ywhere along a line, in whic h case y ou m ust
use a colon ( : ) as the delimiter to terminate the lab el eld. Colon delimiters are not used b y the
ARM assem bler.
Lab els are most frequen tly used in Branc h or SWI instructions. These instructions place a new
v alue in the program coun ter and so alter the normal sequen tial execution of instructions. B150 16
means  plac e the value 150 16 in the pr o gr am c ounter . The next instruction to b e executed will
b e the one in memory lo cation 150 16 . The instruction B START means  plac e the value assigne d
to the lab el START in the pr o gr am c ounter . The next instruction to b e executed will b e the on at
the address corresp onding to the lab el START . Figure 2.1 con tains an example.
Wh y use a lab el? Here are some reasons:
• A lab el mak es a program lo cation easier to nd and remem b er.
• The lab el can easily b e mo v ed, if required, to c hange or correct a program. The assem bler
will automatically c hange all instructions that use the lab el when the program is reassem bled.
2.1. FIELDS 13
Assem bly language Program
START MOV R0, VALUE1
.
. (Main Program)
.
BAL START
When the mac hine language v ersion of this program is executed, the instruction
B START causes the address of the instruction lab eled START to b e placed in the
program coun ter That instruction will then b e executed.
Figure 2.1: Assigning and Using a Lab el
• The assem bler can relo cate the whole program b y adding a constan t (a relo cation constan t)
to eac h address in whic h a lab el w as used. Th us w e can mo v e the program to allo w for the
insertion of other programs or simply to rearrange memory .
• The program is easier to use as a library program; that is, it is easier for someone else to
tak e y our program and add it to some totally dieren t program.
• Y ou do not ha v e to gure out memory addresses. Figuring out memory addresses is partic-
ularly dicult with micropro cessors whic h ha v e instructions that v ary in length.
Y ou should assign a lab el to an y instruction that y ou migh t w an t to refer to later.
The next question is ho w to c ho ose a lab el. The assem bler often places some restrictions on the
n um b er of c haracters (usually 5 or 6), the leading c haracter (often m ust b e a letter), and the
trailing c haracters (often m ust b e letters, n um b ers, or one of a few sp ecial c haracters). Bey ond
these restrictions, the c hoice is up to y ou.
Our o wn preference is to use lab els that suggest their purp ose, i.e., mnemonic lab els. T ypical
examples are ADDW in a routine that adds one w ord in to a sum, SRCHETX in a routine that searc hes
for the ASCI I c haracter ETX, or NKEYS for a lo cation in data memory that con tains the n um b er of
k ey en tries. Meaningful lab els are easier to remem b er and con tribute to program do cumen tation.
Some programmers use a standard format for lab els, suc h as starting with L0000 . These lab els are
self-sequencing (y ou can skip a few n um b ers to p ermit insertions), but they do not help do cumen t
the program.
Some lab el selection rules will k eep y ou out of trouble. W e recommend the follo wing:
• Do not use lab els that are the same as op eration co des or other mnemonics. Most assem blers
will not allo w this usage; others will, but it is confusing.
• Do not use lab els that are longer than the assem bler recognises. Assem blers ha v e v arious
rules, and often ignore some of the c haracters at the end of a long lab el.
• A v oid sp ecial c haracters (non-alphab etic and non-n umeric) and lo w er-case letters. Some
assem blers will not p ermit them; others allo w only certain ones. The simplest practice is to
stic k to capital letters and n um b ers.
• Start eac h lab el with a letter. Suc h lab els are alw a ys acceptable.
• Do not use lab els that could b e confused with eac h other. A v oid the letters I , O , and Z and
the n um b ers 0 , 1 , and 2 . Also a v oid things lik e XXXX and XXXXX . Assem bly programming is
dicult enough without tempting fate or Murph y's La w.
• When y ou are not sure if a lab el is legal, do not use it. Y ou will not get an y real b enet
from disco v ering exactly what the assem bler will accept.
14 CHAPTER 2. ASSEMBLERS
These are recommendations, not rules. Y ou do not ha v e to follo w them but don't blame us if y ou
w aste time on unnecessary problems.
2.2 Op eration Co des (Mnemonics)
One main task of the assem bler is the translation of mnemonic op eration co des in to their binary
equiv alen ts. The assem bler p erforms this task using a xed table m uc h as y ou w ould if y ou w ere
doing the assem bly b y hand.
The assem bler m ust, ho w ev er, do more than just translate the op eration co des. It m ust also
someho w determine ho w man y op erands the instruction requires and what t yp e they are. This
ma y b e rather complex  some instructions (lik e a Stop) ha v e no op erands, others (lik e a Jump
instruction) ha v e one, while still others (lik e a transfer b et w een registers or a m ultiple-bit shift)
require t w o. Some instructions ma y ev en allo w alternativ es; for example, some computers ha v e
instructions (lik e Shift or Clear) whic h can either apply to a register in the CPU or to a memory
lo cation. W e will not discuss ho w the assem bler mak es these distinctions; w e will just note that it
m ust do so.
2.3 Directiv es
Some assem bly language instructions are not directly translated in to mac hine language instruc-
tions. These instructions are directiv es to the assem bler; they assign the program to certain areas
in memory , dene sym b ols, designate areas of memory for data storage, place tables or other xed
data in memory , allo w references to other programs, and p erform minor housek eeping functions.
T o use these assem bler directiv es or pseudo-op erations a programmer places the directiv e's mnemonic
in the op eration co de eld, and, if the sp ecied directiv e requires it, an address or data in the
address eld.
The most common directiv es are:
DEFINE CONST ANT (Data)
EQUA TE (Dene)
AREA
DEFINE STORA GE (Reserv e)
Dieren t assem blers use dieren t names for those op erations but their functions are the same.
Housek eeping directiv es include:
END LIST F ORMA T TTL P A GE INCLUDE
W e will discuss these pseudo-op erations briey , although their functions are usually ob vious.
2.3.1 The DEFINE CONST ANT (Data) Directiv e
The DEFINE CONST ANT directiv e allo ws the programmer to en ter xed data in to program
memory . This data ma y include:
2.3. DIRECTIVES 15
• Names • Con v ersion factors
• Messages • Key iden tications
• Commands • Subroutine addresses
• T ax tables • Co de con v ersion tables
• Thresholds • Iden tication patterns
• T est patterns • State transition tables
• Lo okup tables • Sync hronisation patterns
• Standard forms • Co ecien ts for equations
• Masking patterns • Character generation patterns
• W eigh ting factors • Characteristic times or frequencies
The dene constan t directiv e treats the data as a p ermanen t part of the program.
The format of a dene constan t directiv e is usually quite simple. An instruction lik e:
DZCON DCW 12
will place the n um b er 12 in the next a v ailable memory lo cation and assign that lo cation the name
DZCON . Ev ery DC directiv e usually has a lab el, unless it is one of a series. The data and lab el ma y
tak e an y form that the assem bler p ermits.
More elab orate dene constan t directiv es that handle a large amoun t of data at one time are
pro vided, for example:
EMESS DCB 'ERROR'
SQRS DCW 1,4,9,16,25
A single directiv e ma y ll man y b ytes of program memory , limited p erhaps b y the length of a
line or b y the restrictions of a particular assem bler. Of course, y ou can alw a ys o v ercome an y
restrictions b y follo wing one dene constan t directiv e with another:
MESSG DCB "NOW IS THE "
DCB "TIME FOR ALL "
DCB "GOOD MEN "
DCB "TO COME TO THE "
DCB "AID OF THEIR "
DCB "COUNTRY", 0 ;note the '0' terminating the string
Micropro cessor assem blers t ypically ha v e some v ariations of standard dene constan t directiv es.
Dene Byte or DCB handles 8-bit n um b ers; Dene W ord or DCW handles 32-bit n um b ers or addresses.
Other sp ecial directiv es ma y handle c haracter-co ded data. The ARM assem bler also denes DCD
to (Dene Constan t Data) whic h ma y b e used in place of DCW .
2.3.2 The EQUA TE Directiv e
The EQUA TE directiv e allo ws the programmer to equate names with addresses or data. This
pseudo-op eration is almost alw a ys giv en the mnemonic EQU . The names ma y refer to device ad-
dresses, n umeric data, starting addresses, xed addresses, etc.
The EQUA TE directiv e assigns the n umeric v alue in its op erand eld to the lab el in its lab el eld.
Here are t w o examples:
TTY EQU 5
LAST EQU 5000
16 CHAPTER 2. ASSEMBLERS
Most assem blers will allo w y ou to dene one lab el in terms of another, for example:
LAST EQU FINAL
ST1 EQU START+1
The lab el in the op erand eld m ust, of course, ha v e b een previously dened. Often, the op erand
eld ma y con tain more complex expressions, as w e shall see later. Double name assignmen ts (t w o
names for the same data or address) ma y b e useful in patc hing together programs that use dieren t
names for the same v ariable (or dieren t sp ellings of what w as supp osed to b e the same name).
Note that an EQU directiv e do es not cause the assem bler to place an ything in memory . The as-
sem bler simply en ters an additional name in to a table (called a sym b ol table) whic h the assem bler
main tains.
When do y ou use a name? The answ er is: whenev er y ou ha v e a parameter that y ou migh t w an t to
c hange or that has some meaning b esides its ordinary n umeric v alue. W e t ypically assign names to
time constan ts, device addresses, masking patterns, con v ersion factors, and the lik e. A name lik e
DELAY , TTY , KBD , KROW , or OPEN not only mak es the parameter easier to c hange, but it also adds to
program do cumen tation. W e also assign names to memory lo cations that ha v e sp ecial purp oses;
they ma y hold data, mark the start of the program, or b e a v ailable for in termediate storage.
What name do y ou use? The b est rules are m uc h the same as in the case of lab els, except that
here meaningful names really coun t. Wh y not call the telet yp ewriter TTY instead of X15 , a bit
time dela y BTIME or BTDLY rather than WW , the n um b er of the GO k ey on a k eyb oard GOKEY
rather than HORSE ? This advice seems straigh tforw ard, but a surprising n um b er of programmers
do not follo w it.
Where do y ou place the EQUA TE directiv es? The b est place is at the start of the program, under
appropriate commen t headings suc h as i/o addresses , temporar y stora ge , time const ants ,
or pr ogram loca tions . This mak es the denitions easy to nd if y ou w an t to c hange them.
F urthermore, another user will b e able to lo ok up all the denitions in one cen tralised place.
Clearly this practice impro v es do cumen tation and mak es the program easier to use.
Denitions used only in a sp ecic subroutine should app ear at the start of the subroutine.
2.3.3 The AREA Directiv e
The AREA directiv e allo ws the programmer to sp ecify the memory lo cations where programs,
subroutines, or data will reside. Programs and data ma y b e lo cated in dieren t areas of memory
dep ending on the memory conguration. Startup routines in terrupt service routines, and other
required programs ma y b e scattered around memory at xed or con v enien t addresses.
The assem bler main tains a lo cation coun ter (comparable to the computer's program coun ter) whic h
con tains the lo cation in memory of the instruction or data item b eing pro cessed. An area directiv e
causes the assem bler to place a new v alue in the lo cation coun ter, m uc h as a Jump instruction
causes the CPU to place a new v alue in the program coun ter. The output from the assem bler
m ust not only con tain instructions and data, but m ust also indicate to the loader program where
in memory it should place the instructions and data.
Micropro cessor programs often con tain sev eral AREA statemen ts for the follo wing purp oses:
• Reset (startup) address • Stac k
• In terrupt service addresses • Main program
• T rap (soft w are in terrupt) addresses • Subroutines
• RAM storage • Input/Output
2.4. OPERANDS AND ADDRESSES 17
Still other origin statemen ts ma y allo w ro om for later insertions, place tables or data in memory ,
or assign v acan t memory space for data buers. Program and data memory in micro computers
ma y o ccup y widely separate addresses to simplify the hardw are. T ypical origin statemen ts are:
AREA RESET
AREA $1000
AREA INT3
The assem bler will assume a fak e address if the programmer do es not put in an AREA statemen t.
The AREA statemen t at the start of an ARM program is required, and its absence will cause the
assem bly to fail.
2.3.4 Housek eeping Directiv es
There are v arious assem bler directiv es that aect the op eration of the assem bler and its program
listing rather than the ob ject program itself. Common directiv es include:
END , marks the end of the assem bly language source program. This m ust app ear in the le or a
missing END directiv e error will o ccur.
INCLUDE will include the con ten ts of a named le in to the curren t le. When the included le
has b een pro cessed the assem bler will con tin ue with the next line in the original le. F or
example the follo wing line
INCLUDE MATH.S
will include the con ten t of the le math.s at that p oin t of the le.
Y ou should nev er use a lable with an include directiv e. An y lab els dened in the included le
will b e dened in the curren t le, hence an error will b e rep orted if the same lab el app ears
in b oth the source and include le.
An include le ma y itself include other les, whic h in turn could include other les, and so
on, ho w ev er, the lev el of includes the assem bler will accept is limited. It is not recommended
y ou go b ey ond three lev els for ev en the most complex of soft w are.
2.3.5 When to Use Lab els
Users often w onder if or when they can assign a lab el to an assem bler directiv e. These are our
recommendations:
1. All EQU directiv es m ust ha v e lab els; they are useless otherwise, since the purp ose of an EQU
is to dene its lab el.
2. Dene Constan t and Dene Storage directiv es usually ha v e lab els. The lab el iden ties the
rst memory lo cation used or assigned.
3. Other directiv es should not ha v e lab els.
2.4 Op erands and A ddresses
The assem bler allo w the programmer a lot of freedom in describing the con ten ts of the op erand or
address eld. But remem b er that the assem bler has built-in names for registers and instructions
and ma y ha v e other built-in names. W e will no w describ e some common options for the op erand
eld.
18 CHAPTER 2. ASSEMBLERS
2.4.1 Decimal Num b ers
The assem bler assume all n um b ers to b e decimal unless they are mark ed otherwise. So:
ADD 100
means add the con ten ts of memory lo cation 100 10 to the con ten ts of the A ccum ulator.
2.4.2 Other Num b er Systems
The assem bler will also accept hexadecimal en tries. But y ou m ust iden tify these n um b er systems
in some w a y: for example, b y preceding the n um b er with an iden tifying c haracter.
2_ nnn Binary Base 2
8_ nnn Octal Base 8
nnn Decimal Base 10
0x nnn Hexadecimal Base 16
It is go o d practice to en ter n um b ers in the base in whic h their meaning is the clearest: that is,
decimal constan ts in decimal; addresses and BCD n um b ers in hexadecimal; masking patterns or
bit outputs in hexadecimal.
2.4.3 Names
Names can app ear in the op erand eld; they will b e treated as the data that they represen t.
Remem b er, ho w ev er, that there is a dierence b et w een op erands and addresses. In an ARM
assem bly language program the sequence:
FIVE EQU 5
ADD R2, #FIVE
will add the con ten ts of memory lo cation FIVE (not necessarily the n um b er 5) to the con ten ts of
data register R2 .
2.4.4 Character Co des
The assem bler allo ws text to b e en tered as ASCI I strings. Suc h strings m ust b e surrounded with
double quotation marks, unless a single ASCI I c haracter is quoted, when single qoutes ma y b e
used exactly as in 'C'. W e recommend that y ou use c haracter strings for all text. It impro v es the
clarit y and readabilit y of the program.
2.4.5 Arithmetic and Logical Expressions
Assem blers p ermit com binations of the data forms describ ed ab o v e, connected b y arithmetic,
logical, or sp ecial op erators. These com binations are called expressions. Almost all assem blers
allo w simple arithmetic expressions suc h as START+1 . Some assem blers also p ermit m ultiplication,
division, logical functions, shifts, etc. Note that the assem bler ev aluates expressions at assem bly
time; if a sym b ol app ears in an expression, the address is used (i.e., the lo cation coun ter or
EQUA TE v alue).
Assem blers v ary in what expressions they accept and ho w they in terpret them. Complex expres-
sions mak e a program dicult to read and understand.
2.5. COMMENTS 19
2.4.6 General Recommendations
W e ha v e made some recommendations during this section but will rep eat them and add others
here. In general, the user should striv e for clarit y and simplicit y . There is no pa y o for b eing an
exp ert in the in tricacies of an assem bler or in ha ving the most complex expression on the blo c k.
W e suggest the follo wing approac h:
• Use the clearest n um b er system or c haracter co de for data.
• Masks and BCD n um b ers in decimal, ASCI I c haracters in o ctal, or ordinary n umerical
constan ts in hexadecimal serv e no purp ose and therefore should not b e used.
• Remem b er to distinguish data from addresses.
• Don't use osets from the lo cation coun ter.
• Keep expressions simple and ob vious. Don't rely on obscure features of the assem bler.
2.5 Commen ts
All assem blers allo w y ou to place commen ts in a source program. Commen ts ha v e no eect on the
ob ject co de, but they help y ou to read, understand, and do cumen t the program. Go o d commen ting
is an essen tial part of writing computer programs, programs without commen ts are v ery dicult
to understand.
W e will discuss commen ting along with do cumen tation in a later c hapter, but here are some
guidelines:
• Use commen ts to tell what application task the program is p erforming, not ho w the micro-
computer executes the instructions.
• Commen ts should sa y things lik e is temp erature ab o v e limit?, linefeed to TTY, or ex-
amine load switc h.
• Commen ts should not sa y things lik e add 1 to A ccum ulator, jump to Start, or lo ok at
carry . Y ou should describ e ho w the program is aecting the system; in ternal eects on the
CPU should b e ob vious from the co de.
• Keep commen ts brief and to the p oin t. Details should b e a v ailable elsewhere in the do cu-
men tation.
• Commen t all k ey p oin ts.
• Do not commen t standard instructions or sequences that c hange coun ters or p oin ters; pa y
sp ecial atten tion to instructions that ma y not ha v e an ob vious meaning.
• Do not use obscure abbreviations.
• Mak e the commen ts neat and readable.
• Commen t all denitions, describing their purp oses. Also mark all tables and data storage
areas.
• Commen t sections of the program as w ell as individual instructions.
• Be consisten t in y our terminology . Y ou can (should) b e rep etitiv e, y ou need not consult a
thesaurus.
20 CHAPTER 2. ASSEMBLERS
• Lea v e y ourself notes at p oin ts that y ou nd confusing: for example, remem b er carry w as set
b y last instruction. If suc h p oin ts get cleared up later in program dev elopmen t, y ou ma y
drop these commen ts in the nal do cumen tation.
A w ell-commen ted program is easy to use. Y ou will reco v er the time sp en t in commen ting man y
times o v er. W e will try to sho w go o d commen ting st yle in the programming examples, although
w e often o v er-commen t for instructional purp oses.
2.6 T yp es of Assem blers
Although all assem blers p erform the same tasks, their implemen tations v ary greatly . W e will not
try to describ e all the existing t yp es of assem blers, w e will merely dene the terms and indicate
some of the c hoices.
A cr oss-assembler is an assem bler that runs on a computer other than the one for whic h it assem bles
ob ject programs. The computer on whic h the cross-assem bler runs is t ypically a large computer
with extensiv e soft w are supp ort and fast p eripherals. The computer for whic h the cross-assem bler
assem bles programs is t ypically a micro lik e the 6809 or MC68000.
When a new micro computer is in tro duced, a cross-assem bler is often pro vided to run on existing
dev elopmen t systems. F or example, ARM pro vide the 'Arm ulator' cross-assem bler that will run
on a PC dev elopmen t system.
A self-assembler or r esident assembler is an assem bler that runs on the computer for whic h it
assem bles programs. The self-assem bler will require some memory and p eripherals, and it ma y
run quite slo wly compared to a cross-assem bler.
A macr o assembler is an assem bler that allo ws y ou to dene sequences of instructions as macros.
A micr o assembler is an assem bler used to write the microprograms whic h dene the instruction
set of a computer. Microprogramming has nothing sp ecically to do with programming micro-
computers, but has to do with the in ternal op eration of the computer.
A meta-assembler is an assem bler that can handle man y dieren t instruction sets. The user m ust
dene the particular instruction set b eing used.
A one-p ass assembler is an assem bler that go es through the assem bly language program only
once. Suc h an assem bler m ust ha v e some w a y of resolving forw ard references, for example, Jump
instructions whic h use lab els that ha v e not y et b een dened.
A two-p ass assembler is an assem bler that go es through the assem bly language source program
t wice. The rst time the assem bler simply collects and denes all the sym b ols; the second time
it replaces the references with the actual denitions. A t w o-pass assem bler has no problems with
forw ard references but ma y b e quite slo w if no bac kup storage (lik e a opp y disk) is a v ailable;
then the assem bler m ust ph ysically read the program t wice from a slo w input medium (lik e a
telet yp ewriter pap er tap e reader). Most micropro cessor-based assem blers require t w o passes.
2.7 Errors
Assem blers normally pro vide error messages, often consisting of an error co de n um b er. Some
t ypical errors are:
2.8. LO ADERS 21
Undened name Often a missp elling or an omitted denition
Illegal c haracter Suc h as a 2 in a binary n um b er
Illegal format A wrong delimiter or incorrect op erands
In v alid expression for example, t w o op erators in a ro w
Illegal v alue Usually the v alue is to o large
Missing op erand Prett y self explanatory
Double denition T w o dieren t v alues assigned to one name
Illegal lab el Suc h as a lab el on a pseudo-op eration that cannot ha v e one
Missing lab el Probably a miss sp elt lable name
Undened op eration co de
In in terpreting assem bler errors, y ou m ust remem b er that the assem bler ma y get on the wrong
trac k if it nds a stra y letter, an extra space, or incorrect punctuation. The assem bler will
then pro ceed to misin terpret the succeeding instructions and pro duce meaningless error messages.
Alw a ys lo ok at the rst error v ery carefully; subsequen t ones ma y dep end on it. Caution and
consisten t adherence to standard formats will eliminate man y anno ying mistak es.
2.8 Loaders
The loader is the program whic h actually tak es the output (ob ject co de) from the assem bler and
places it in memory . Loaders range from the v ery simple to the v ery complex. W e will describ e a
few dieren t t yp es.
A b o otstr ap lo ader is a program that uses its o wn rst few instructions to load the rest of itself
or another loader program in to memory . The b o otstrap loader ma y b e in R OM, or y ou ma y ha v e
to en ter it in to the computer memory using fron t panel switc hes. The assem bler ma y place a
b o otstrap loader at the start of the ob ject program that it pro duces.
A r elo c ating lo ader can load programs an ywhere in memory . It t ypically loads eac h program
in to the memory space immediately follo wing that used b y the previous program. The programs,
ho w ev er, m ust themselv es b e capable of b eing mo v ed around in this w a y; that is, they m ust b e
relo catable. An absolute lo ader, in con trast, will alw a ys place the programs in the same area of
memory .
A linking lo ader loads programs and subroutines that ha v e b een assem bled separately; it resolv es
cross-references  that is, instructions in one program that refer to a lab el in another program.
Ob ject programs loaded b y a linking loader m ust b e created b y an assem bler that allo ws external

3ARM Architecture
This c hapter outlines the ARM pro cessor's arc hitecture and describ es the syn tax rules of the ARM
assem bler. Later c hapters of this b o ok describ e the ARM's stac k and exception pro cessing system
in more detail.
Figure 3.1 on the follo wing page sho ws the in ternal structure of the ARM pro cessor. The ARM
is a R e duc e d Instruction Set Computer (RISC) system and includes the attributes t ypical to that
t yp e of system:
• A large arra y of uniform registers.
• A load/store mo del of data-pro cessing where op erations can only op erate on registers and not
directly on memory . This requires that all data b e loaded in to registers b efore an op eration
can b e preformed, the result can then b e used for further pro cessing or stored bac k in to
memory .
• A small n um b er of addressing mo des with all load/store addresses b egin determined from
registers and instruction elds only .
• A uniform xed length instruction (32-bit).
In addition to these traditional features of a RISC system the ARM pro vides a n um b er of additional
features:
• Separate A rithmetic L o gic Unit (ALU) and shifter giving additional con trol o v er data pro-
cessing to maximize execution sp eed.
• Auto-incremen t and Auto-decremen t addressing mo des to impro v e the op eration of program
lo ops.
• Conditional execution of instructions to reduce pip eline ushing and th us increase execution
sp eed.
3.1 Pro cessor mo des
The ARM supp orts the sev en pro cessor mo des sho wn in table 3.1.
Mo de c hanges can b e made under soft w are con trol, or can b e caused b y external in terrupts or
exception pro cessing.
Most application programs execute in User mo de. While the pro cessor is in User mo de, the
program b eing executed is unable to access some protected system resources or to c hange mo de,
other than b y causing an exception to o ccur (see 3.4 on page 29). This allo ws a suitably written
op erating system to con trol the use of system resources.

The mo des other than User mo de are kno wn as privile ge d mo des . They ha v e full access to system
resources and can c hange mo de freely . Fiv e of them are kno wn as exc eption mo des : FIQ (F ast
In terrupt), IR Q (In terrupt), Sup ervisor, Ab ort, and Undened. These are en tered when sp ecic
exceptions o ccur. Eac h of them has some additional registers to a v oid corrupting User mo de state
when the exception o ccurs (see 3.2 for details).
The remaining mo de is System mo de, it is not en tered b y an y exception and has exactly the same
registers a v ailable as User mo de. Ho w ev er, it is a privileged mo de and is therefore not sub ject to
the User mo de restrictions. It is in tended for use b y op erating system tasks whic h need access to
system resources, but wish to a v oid using the additional registers asso ciated with the exception
mo des. A v oiding suc h use ensures that the task state is not corrupted b y the o ccurrence of an y
exception.
3.2 Registers
The ARM has a total of 37 registers. These comprise 30 general purp ose registers, 6 status registers
and a program coun ter. Figure 3.2 illustrates the registers of the ARM. Only fteen of the general
purp ose registers are a v ailable at an y one time dep ending on the pro cessor mo de.
There are a standard set of eigh t general purp ose registers that are alw a ys a v ailable ( R 0  R 7 ) no
matter whic h mo de the pro cessor is in. These registers are truly general-purp ose, with no sp ecial
uses b eing placed on them b y the pro cessors' arc hitecture.
A few registers ( R 8  R 12 ) are common to all pro cessor mo des with the exception of the q
mo de. This means that to all in ten t and purp ose these are general registers and ha v e no sp ecial
use. Ho w ev er, when the pro cessor is in the fast in terrupt mo de these registers and replaced with
dieren t set of registers ( R 8_q - R 12_q ). Although the pro cessor do es not giv e an y sp ecial
purp ose to these registers they can b e used to hold information b et w een fast in terrupts. Y ou can
consider they to b e static registers. The idea is that y ou can mak e a fast in terrupt ev en faster
b y holding information in these registers.
The general purp ose registers can b e used to handle 8-bit b ytes, 16-bit half-w ords1, or 32-bit
w ords. When w e use a 32-bit register in a b yte instruction only the least signican t 8 bits are
used. In a half-w ord instruction only the least signican t 16 bits are used. Figure 3.3 demonstrates
this.
The remaining registers ( R 13  R 15 ) are sp ecial purp ose registers and ha v e v ery sp ecic roles:
R 13 is also kno wn as the Stac k P oin ter, while R 14 is kno wn as the Link Register, and R 15 is
the Program Coun ter. The user ( usr ) and System ( sys ) mo des share the same registers. The
exception mo des all ha v e their o wn v ersion of these registers. Making a reference to register R 14
will assume y ou are referring to the register for the curren t pro cessor mo de. If y ou wish to refer

to the user mo de v ersion of this register y ou ha v e refer to the R 14_usr register. Y ou ma y only
refer to register from other mo des when the pro cessor is in one of the privileged mo des, i.e., an y
mo de other than user mo de.
There are also one or t w o status registers dep ending on whic h mo de the pro cessor is in. The Cur-
ren t Pro cessor Status Register ( CPSR ) holds information ab out the curren t status of the pro cessor
(including its curren t mo de). In the exception mo des there is an additional Sa v ed Pro cessor Status
Register ( SPSR ) whic h holds information on the pro cessors state b efore the system c hanged in to
this mo de, i.e., the pro cessor status just b efore an exception.
3.2.1 The stac k p oin ter, SP or R 13
Register R 13 is used as a stac k p oin ter and is also kno wn as the SP register. Eac h exception mo de
has its o wn v ersion of R 13 , whic h p oin ts to a stac k dedicated to that exception mo de.
The stac k is t ypically used to store temp orary v alues. It is normal to store the con ten ts of an y
registers a function is going to use on the stac k on en try to a subroutine. This lea v es the register
free for use during the function. The routine can then reco v er the register v alues from the stac k
3.2. REGISTERS 27
on exit from the subroutine. In this w a y the subroutine can preserv e the v alue of the register and
not corrupt the v alue as w ould otherwise b e the case.
See Chapter 15 for more information on using the stac k.
3.2.2 The Link Register, LR or R 14
Register R 14 is also kno wn as the Link R e gister or LR .
It is used to hold the return address for a subroutine. When a subroutine call is p erformed via a
BL instruction, R 14 is set to the address of the next instruction. T o return from a subroutine y ou
need to cop y the Link Register in to the Program Coun ter. This is t ypically done in one of the t w o
w a ys:
• Execute either of these instructions:
MOV PC, LR or BAL LR
• On en try to the subroutine store R 14 to the stac k with an instruction of the form:
STMFD SP!,{/angbracketleft r e gisters/angbracketright , LR}
and use a matc hing instruction to return from the subroutine:
LDMFD SP!,{/angbracketleft r e gisters/angbracketright , PC}
This sa v es the Link Register on the stac k at the start of the subroutine. On exit from the
subroutine it collects all the v alues it placed on the stac k, including the return address that
w as in the Link Register, except it returns this address directly in to the Program Coun ter
instead.
See Chapter ?? on page ?? for further details of using the stac k, and Chapter 15 on page 113 for
further details on using subroutines.
When an exception o ccurs, the exception mo de's v ersion of R 14 is set to the address after the
instruction whic h has just b een completed. The SPSR is a cop y of the CPSR just b efore the
exception o ccurred. The return from an exception is p erformed in a similar w a y to a subroutine
return, but using sligh tly dieren t instructions to ensure full restoration of the state of the program
that w as b eing executed when the exception o ccurred. See 3.4 on page 29 for more details.
3.2.3 The program coun ter, PC or R 15
Register R 15 holds the Pr o gr am Counter kno wn as the PC . It is used to iden tify whic h instruction
is to b e preformed next . As the PC holds the address of the next instruction it is often referred
to as an instruction p ointer . The name program coun ter dates bac k to the times when program
instructions where read in o of punc hed cards, it refers to the card p osition within a stac k of
cards. In spite of its name it do es not actually coun t an ything!
Reading the program coun ter
When an instruction reads the PC the v alue returned is the address of the curren t instruction plus
8 b ytes. This is the address of the instruction after the next instruction to b e executed2.
2This is caused b y the pro cessor ha ving already fetc hed the next instruction from memory while it w as deciding
what the curren t instruction w as. Th us the PC is still the next instruction to b e executed, but that is not the
instruction immediately after the curren t one.
28 CHAPTER 3. ARM AR CHITECTURE
This w a y of reading the PC is primarily used for quic k, p osition-indep enden t addressing of nearb y
instructions and data, including p osition-indep enden t branc hing within a program.
An exception to this rule o ccurs when an STR (Store Register) or STM (Store Multiple Registers)
instruction stores R 15 . The v alue stored is UNKNO WN and it is b est to a v oid the use of these
instructions that store R 15 .
W riting the program coun ter
When an instruction writes to R 15 the normal result is that the v alue written is treated as an
instruction address and the system starts to execute the instruction at that address3.
3.2.4 Curren t Pro cessor Status Registers: CPSR
Rather surprisingly the curr ent pr o c essor status r e gister ( CPSR ) con tains the curren t status of the
pro cessor. This includes v arious condition co de ags, in terrupt status, pro cessor mo de and other
status and con trol information.
The exception mo des also ha v e a save d pr o c essor status r e gister ( SPSR ), that is used to preserv e
the v alue of the CPSR when the asso ciated exception o ccurs. Because the User and System mo des
are not exception mo des, there is no SPSR a v ailable.
Figure 3.4 sho ws the format of the CPSR and the SPSR registers.

Figure 3.4: Structure of the Pro cessor Status Registers
The pro cessors' status is split in to t w o distinct parts: the User ags and the Systems Con trol
ags. The upp er halfw ord is accessible in User mo de and con tains a set of ags whic h can b e
used to eect the op eration of a program, see section 3.3. The lo w er halfw ord con tains the System
Con trol information.
An y bit not curren tly used is reserv ed for future use and should b e zero, and are mark ed SBZ in
the gure. The I and F bits indicate if In terrupts ( I ) or F ast In terrupts ( F ) are allo w ed. The Mo de
bits indicate whic h op erating mo de the pro cessor is in (see 3.1 on page 23).
The system ags can only b e altered when the pro cessor is in protected mo de. User mo de programs
can not alter the status register except for the condition co de ags.
3.3 Flags
The upp er four bits of the status register con tains a set of four ags, collectiv ely kno wn at the
c ondition c o de . The condition co de ags are:
Negativ e (N)
Zero (Z)
Carry (C)
Ov ero w (V)
3As the pro cessor has already fetc hed the instruction after the curren t instruction it is required to ush the
instruction cac he and start again. This will cause a short, but not signican t, dela y .
3.4. EX CEPTIONS 29
The condition co de can b e used to con trol the o w of the program execution. The is often
abbreviated to just /angbracketleft c c/angbracketright .
N The Negativ e (sign) ag tak es on the v alue of the most signican t bit of a result. Th us
when an op eration pro duces a negativ e result the negativ e ag is set and a p ositiv e
result results in a the negativ e ag b eing reset. This assumes the v alues are in standard
t w o's complemen t form. If the v alues are unsigned the negativ e ag can b e ignored or
used to iden tify the v alue of the most signican t bit of the result.
Z The Zero ag is set when an op eration pro duces a zero result. It is reset when an
op eration pro duces a non-zero result.
C The Carry ag holds the carry from the most signican t bit pro duced b y arithmetic op-
erations or shifts. As with most pro cessors, the carry ag is in v erted after a subtraction
so that the ag acts as a b orro w ag after a subtraction.
V The Ov ero w ag is set when an arithmetic result is greater than can b e represen ted in
a register.
Man y instructions can mo dify the ags, these include comparison, arithmetic, logical and mo v e
instructions. Most of the instructions ha v e an S qualier whic h instructs the pro cessor to set the
condition co de ags or not.
3.4 Exceptions
Exceptions are generated b y in ternal and external sources to cause the pro cessor to handle an ev en t,
suc h as an externally generated in terrupt or an attempt to execute an undened instruction. The
ARM supp orts sev en t yp es of exception, and a pro vides a privileged pro cessing mo de for eac h
t yp e. T able 3.2 lists the t yp e of exception and the pro cessor mo de asso ciated with it.
When an exception o ccurs, some of the standard registers are replaced with registers sp ecic to the
exception mo de. All exception mo des ha v e their o wn Stac k P oin ter ( SP ) and Link ( LR ) registers.
The fast in terrupt mo de has more registers ( R 8_q  R 12_q ) for fast in terrupt pro cessing.

T able 3.2: Exception pro cessing mo des
The sev en exceptions are:
Reset when the Reset pin is held lo w, this is normally when the system is rst turned on or when
the reset button is pressed.
Soft w are In terrupt is generally used to allo w user mo de programs to call the op erating system.
The user program executes a soft w are in terrupt ( SWI , A.18 on page 135) instruction with a
argumen t whic h iden ties the function the user wishes to preform.
30 CHAPTER 3. ARM AR CHITECTURE
Undened Instruction is when an attempt is made to preform an undened instruction. This
normally happ ens when there is a logical error in the program and the pro cessor starts to
execute data rather than program co de.
Prefetc h Ab ort o ccurs when the pro cessor attempts to access memory that do es not exist.
Data Ab ort o ccurs when attempting to access a w ord on a non-w ord aligned b oundary . The
lo w er t w o bits of a memory m ust b e zero when accessing a w ord.
In terrupt o ccurs when an external device asserts the IR Q (in terrupt) pin on the pro cessor. This
can b e used b y external devices to request atten tion from the pro cessor. An in terrupt can
not b e in terrupted with the exception of a fast in terrupt.
F ast In terrupt o ccurs when an external device asserts the FIQ (fast in terrupt) pin. This is
designed to supp ort data transfer and has sucien t priv ate registers to remo v e the need for
register sa ving in suc h applications. A fast in terrupt can not b e in terrupted.
When an exception o ccurs, the pro cessor halts execution after the curren t instruction. The state
of the pro cessor is preserv ed in the Save d Pr o c essor Status R e gister ( SPSR ) so that the original
program can b e resumed when the exception routine has completed. The address of the instruction
the pro cessor w as just ab out to execute is placed in to the Link Register of the appropriate pro cessor
mo de. The pro cessor is no w ready to b egin execution of the exception handler.
The exception handler are lo cated a pre-dened lo cations kno wn as exc eption ve ctors . It is the
resp onsibilit y of an op erating system to pro vide suitable exception handling.
3.5 Instruction Set
Wh y are a micropro cessor's instructions referred to as an instruction set? Because the micropro-
cessor designer selects the instruction complemen t with great care; it m ust b e easy to execute
complex op erations as a sequence of simple ev en ts, eac h of whic h is represen ted b y one instruction
from a w ell-designed instruction set.
Assem bler often frigh ten users who are new to programming. Y et tak en in isolation, the op erations
in v olv ed in the execution of a single instruction are usually easy to follo w. F urthermore, y ou need
not attempt to understand all the instructions at once. As y ou study eac h of the programs in
these notes y ou will learn ab out the sp ecic instructions in v olv ed.
T able 4.1 lists the instruction mnemonics. This pro vides a surv ey of the pro cessors capabilities,
and will also b e useful when y ou need a certain kind of op eration but are either unsure of the
sp ecic mnemonics or not y et familiar with what instructions are a v ailable.
See Chapter ?? and App endix ?? for a detailed description of the individual instructions and
c hapters 7 through to 15 for a discussion on ho w to use them.
The ARM instruction set can b e divided in to six broad classes of instruction.
• Data Mo v emen t • Logical and Bit Manipulation
• Arithmetic • Flo w Con trol
• Memory A ccess • System Con trol / Privileged
Before w e lo ok at eac h of these groups in a little more detail there are a few ideas whic h b elong

T able 3.4:/angbracketleft c c/angbracketright (Condition co de) Mnemonics
3.5.1 Conditional Execution: /angbracketleft c c/angbracketright
Almost all ARM instructions con tain a c ondition eld whic h allo ws it to b e executed conditionally
dep enden t on the condition co de ags (3.3 on page 28). If the ags indicate that the corresp onding
condition is true when the instruction starts executing, it executes normally . Otherwise, the
instruction do es nothing.
T able 4.2 on page 42 sho ws a list of the condition co des and their mnemonics. T o indicate that an
instruction is conditional w e simply place the mnemonic for the condition co de after the mnemonic
for the instruction. If no condition co de mnemonic is used the instruction will alw a ys b e executed.
F or example the follo wing instruction will mo v e the v alue of the register R 1 in to the R 0 register
only when the Carry ag has b een set, R 0 will remain unaected if the C ag w as clear.
MOVCS R0, R1
Note that the Gr e ater and the L ess conditions are for use with signed n um b ers while the Higher
and L ower conditions are for use with unsigned n um b ers. These condition co des only really mak e
seance after a comparison ( CMP ) instruction, see A.5 on page 129.
32 CHAPTER 3. ARM AR CHITECTURE
Most data-pro cessing instructions can also up date the condition co des according to their result.
Placing an  S  after the mnemonic will cause the ags to b e up dated. F or example there are t w o
v ersions of the MOV instruction:
MOV R0, #0 Will mo v e the v alue 0 in to the register R 0 without setting the ags.
MOVS R0, #0 Will do the same, mo v e the v alue 0 in to the register R 0 , but it will also set
the condition co de ags accordingly , the Zero ag will b e set, the Negativ e ag
will b e reset and the Carry and oV ero w ags will not b e eected.
If an instruction has this abilit y w e denote it using /angbracketleft S/angbracketright in our description of the instruction. The
/angbracketleft S/angbracketright alw a ys comes after the /angbracketleft c c/angbracketright (conditional execution) mo dication if it is giv en. Th us the full
description of the mo v e instruction w ould b e:
MOV/angbracketleft c c/angbracketright/angbracketleft S/angbracketright R d ,/angbracketleft op1/angbracketright
With all this in mind what do es the follo wing co de fragmen t do?
MOVS R0, R1
MOVEQS R0, R2
MOVEQ R0, R3
The rst instruction will mo v e R 1 in to R 0 unconditionally , but it will also set the N and Z ags
accordingly . Th us the second instruction is only executed if the Z ag is set, i.e., the v alue of R 1
w as zero. If the v alue of R 1 w as not zero the instruction is skipp ed. If the second instruction is
executed it will cop y the v alue of R 2 in to R 0 and it will also set the N and Z ags according to
the v alue of R 2 . Th us the third instruction is only executed if b oth R 1 and R 2 are b oth zero.
3.5.2 Data Pro cessing Op erands: /angbracketleft op1/angbracketright
The ma jorit y of the instructions relate to data pro cessing of some form. One of the op erands
to these instructions is routed through the Barrel Shifter. This means that the op erand can b e
mo died b efore it is used. This can b e v ery useful when dealing with lists, tables and other
complex data structures. W e denote instructions of this t yp e as taking one of its argumen ts from
/angbracketleft op1/angbracketright .
An/angbracketleft op1/angbracketright argumen t ma y come from one of t w o sources, a constan t v alue or a register, and b e
mo died in v e dieren t w a ys. See Chapter ?? for more detailed information.
Unmo died V alue
Y ou can use a v alue or a register unmo died b y simply giving the v alue or the register name. F or
example the follo wing instructions will demonstrate the t w o metho ds:
MOV R0, #1234 Will mo v e the immediate constan t v alue 1234 10 in to the register R 0
MOV R0, R1 Will mo v e the v alue in the register R 1 in to the register R 0
Logical Shift Left
This will tak e the v alue of a register and shift the v alue up, to w ards the most signican t bit, b y n
bits. The n um b er of bits to shift is sp ecied b y either a constan t v alue or another register. The
lo w er bits of the v alue are replaced with a zero. This is a simple w a y of p erforming a m ultiply b y
a p o w er of 2 (×2n).
3.5. INSTR UCTION SET 33
MOV R0, R1, LSL #2 R 0 will b ecome the v alue of R 1 shifted left b y 2 bits. The v alue of R 1
is not c hanged.
MOV R0, R1, LSL R2 R 0 will b ecome the v alue of R 1 shifted left b y the n um b er of bits
sp ecied in the R 2 register. R 0 is the only register to c hange, b oth R 1
and R 2 are not eected b y this op eration.
If the instruction is to set the status register, the carry ag ( C ) is the last bit that w as shifted out
of the v alue.
Logical Shift Righ t
Logical Shift Righ t is v ery similar to Logical Shift Left except it will shift the v alue to the righ t,
to w ards the lest signican t bit, b y n bits. It will replace the upp er bits with zeros, th us pro viding
an ecien t unsigned divide b y 2nfunction (|÷2n| ). The n um b er of bits to shift ma y b e sp ecied
b y either a constan t v alue or another register.
MOV R0, R1, LSR #2 R 0 will tak e on the v alue of R 1 shifted to the righ t b y 2 bits. The

MOV R0, R1, LSR R2 As b efore R 0 will b ecome the v alue of R 1 shifted to the righ t b y the
n um b er of bits sp ecied in the R 2 register. R 1 and R 2 are not altered
b y this op eration.
If the instruction is to set the status register, the carry ag ( C ) is the last bit to b e shifted out of
the v alue.
Arithmetic Shift Righ t
The Arithmetic Shift Righ t is rather similar to the Logical Shift Righ t, but rather than replacing
the upp er bits with a zero, it main tains the v alue of the most signican t bit. As the most signican t
bit is used to hold the sign, this means the sign of the v alue is main tained, th us pro viding a signed
divide b y 2nop eration (÷2n).
MOV R0, R1, ASR #2 Register R 0 will b ecome the v alue of register R 1 shifted to the righ t
b y 2 bits, with the sign main tained.
MOV R0, R1, ASR R2 Register R 0 will b ecome the v alue of the register R 1 shifted to the
righ t b y the n um b er of bits sp ecied b y the R 2 register. R 1 and R 2
are not altered b y this op eration.
Giv en the distinction b et w een the Logical and Arithmetic Shift Righ t, wh y is there no Arithmetic
Shift Left op eration?
As a signed n um b er is stored in t w o's complemen t the upp er most bits hold the sign of the n um b er.
These bits can b e considered insignican t unless the n um b er is of a sucien t size to require their
use. Th us an Arithmetic Shift Left is not required as the sign is automatically preserv ed b y the
Logical Shift.
Rotate Righ t
In the Rotate Righ t op eration, the lest signican t bit is copied in to the carry ( C ) ag, while the
v alue of the C ag is copied in to the most signican t bit of the v alue. In this w a y none of the bits
in the v alue are lost, but are simply mo v ed from the lo w er bits to the upp er bits of the v alue.
34 CHAPTER 3. ARM AR CHITECTURE
MOV R0, R1, ROR #2 This will rotate the v alue of R 1 b y t w o bits. The most signican t bit
of the resulting v alue will b e the same as the least signican t bit of
the original v alue. The second most signican t bit will b e the same
as the Carry ag. In the S v ersion the Carry ag will b e set to the
second least signican t bit of the original v alue. The v alue of R 1 is
not c hanged b y this op eration.
MOV R0, R1, ROR R2 Register R 0 will b ecome the v alue of the register R 1 rotated to the
righ t b y the n um b er of bits sp ecied b y the R 2 register. R 1 and R 2
are not altered b y this op eration.
Wh y is there no corresp onding Rotate Left op eration?
An A dd With Carry ( ADC , A.1 on page 127) to a zero v alue pro vides this service for a single bit.
The designers of the instruction set b eliev e that a Rotate Left b y more than one bit w ould nev er
b e required, th us they ha v e not pro vided a R OL function.
Rotate Righ t Extended
This is similar to a Rotate Righ t b y one bit. The extende d section of the fact that this function
mo v es the v alue of the Carry ( C ) ag in to the most signican t bit of the v alue, and the least
signican t bit of the v alue in to the Carry ( C ) ag. Th us it allo ws the Carry ag to b e propagated
though m ulti-w ord v alues, thereb y allo wing v alues larger than 32-bits to b e used in calculations.
MOV R0, R1 RRX The register R 0 b ecome the same as the v alue of the register R 1 rotated
though the carry ag b y one bit. The most signican t bit of the v alue
b ecomes the same as the curren t Carry ag, while the Carry ag will b e the
same as the least signican t bit or R 1 . The v alue of R 1 will not b e c hanged.
3.5.3 Memory A ccess Op erands: /angbracketleft op2/angbracketright
The memory address used in the memory access instructions ma y also mo died b y the barrel
shifter. This pro vides for more adv anced access to memory whic h is particularly useful when
dealing with more adv anced data structures. It allo ws pre- and p ost-incremen t instructions that
up date memory p oin ters as a side eect of the instruction. This mak es lo ops whic h pass though
memory more ecien t. W e denote instructions of this t yp e as taking one of its argumen ts from
/angbracketleft op2/angbracketright . F or a full discussion of the /angbracketleft op2/angbracketright addressing mo de w e refer the reader to Chapter ?? on
page ?? .
There are three main metho ds of sp ecifying a memory address ( /angbracketleft op2/angbracketright ), all of whic h include an
oset v alue of some form. This oset can b e sp ecied in one of three w a ys:
Constan t V alue
An immediate constan t v alue can b e pro vided. If no oset is sp ecied an immediate constan t
v alue of zero is assumed.
Register
The oset can b e sp ecied b y another register. The v alue of the register is added to the
address held in another register to form the nal address.
Scaled
The oset is sp ecied b y another register whic h can b e scaled b y one of the shift op erators
used for/angbracketleft op1/angbracketright . More sp ecically b y the Logical Shift Left ( LSL ), Logical Shift Righ t ( LSR ),
Arithmetic Shift Righ t ( ASR ), R Otate Righ t ( ROR ) or Rotate Righ t Extended ( RRX ) shift
op erators, where the n um b er of bits to shift is sp ecied as a constan t v alue.
3.5. INSTR UCTION SET 35
Oset A ddressing
In oset addr essing the memory address is formed b y adding (or subtracting) an oset to or from
the v alue held in a base register.
LDR R0, [R1] Will load the register R 0 with the 32-bit w ord at the memory
address held in the register R 1 . In this instruction there is no
oset sp ecied, so an oset of zero is assumed. The v alue of
R 1 is not c hanged in this instruction.
LDR R0, [R1, #4] Will load the register R 0 with the w ord at the memory ad-
dress calculated b y adding the constan t v alue 4 to the memory
address con tained in the R 1 register. The register R 1 is not
c hanged b y this instruction.
LDR R0, [R1, R2] Loads the register R 0 with the v alue at the memory address
calculated b y adding the v alue in the register R 1 to the v alue
held in the register R 2 . Both R 1 and R 2 are not altered b y
this op eration.
LDR R0, [R1, R2, LSL #2] Will load the register R 0 with the 32-bit v alue at the memory
address calculated b y adding the v alue in the R 1 register to the
v alue obtained b y shifting the v alue in R 2 left b y 2 bits. Both
registers, R 1 and R 2 are not eected b y this op eration.
This is particularly useful for indexing in to a complex data structure. The start of the data
structure is held in a b ase register, R 1 in this case, and the oset to access a particular eld within
the structure is then added to the base address. Placing the oset in a register allo ws it to b e
calculated at run time rather than xed. This allo ws for lo oping though a table.
A scaled v alue can also b e used to access a particular item of a table, where the size of the item
is a p o w er of t w o. F or example, to lo cate item 7 in a table of 32-bit v alues w e need only shift the
index v alue 6 left b y 2 bits ( 6×22) to calculate the v alue w e need to add as an oset to the start
of the table held in a register, R 1 in our example. Remem b er that the computer coun t from zero,
th us w e use an index v alue of 6 rather than 7. A 32-bit n um b er requires 4 b ytes of storage whic h
is22, th us w e only need a 2-bit left shift.
Pre-Index A ddressing
In pr e-index addr essing the memory address if formed in the same w a y as for oset addressing.
The address is not only used to access memory , but the base register is also mo died to hold
the new v alue. In the ARM system this is kno wn as a write-b ack and is denoted b y placing a
exclamation mark after at the end of the /angbracketleft op2/angbracketright co de.
Pre-Index address can b e particularly useful in a lo op as it can b e used to automatically incremen t
or decremen t a coun ter or memory p oin ter.
36 CHAPTER 3. ARM AR CHITECTURE
LDR R0, [R1, #4]! Will load the register R 0 with the w ord at the memory address
calculated b y adding the constan t v alue 4 to the memory ad-
dress con tained in the R 1 register. The new memory address
is placed bac k in to the base register, register R 1 .
LDR R0, [R1, R2]! Loads the register R 0 with the v alue at the memory address
calculated b y adding the v alue in the register R 1 to the v alue
held in the register R 2 . The oset register, R 2 , is not altered
b y this op eration, the register holding the base address, R 1 ,
is mo died to hold the new address.
LDR R0, [R1, R2, LSL #2]! First calculates the new address b y adding the v alue in the
base address register, R 1 , to the v alue obtained b y shifting
the v alue in the oset register, R 2 , left b y 2 bits. It will then
load the 32-bit at this address in to the destination register, R 0 .
The new address is also written bac k in to the base register, R 1 .
The oset register, R 2 , will not b e eected b y this op eration.
P ost-Index A ddressing
In p ost-index addr ess the memory address is the base register v alue. As a side-eect, an oset
is added to or subtracted from the base register v alue and the result is written bac k to the base
register.
P ost-index addressing uses the v alue of the base register without mo dication. It then applies the
mo dication to the address and writes the new address bac k in to the base register. This can b e
used to automatically incremen t or decremen t a memory p oin ter after it has b een used, so it is
p oin ting to the next lo cation to b e used.
As the instruction m ust preform a write-bac k w e do not need to include an exclamation mark.
Rather w e mo v e the closing brac k et to include only the base register, as that is the register holding
the memory address w e are going to access.
LDR R0, [R1], #4 Will load the register R 0 with the w ord at the memory address
con tained in the base register, R 1 . It will then calculate the
new v alue of R 1 b y adding the constan t v alue 4 to the curren t
v alue of R 1 .
LDR R0, [R1], R2 Loads the register R 0 with the v alue at the memory address
held in the base register, R 1 . It will then calculate the new
v alue for the base register b y adding the v alue in the oset
register, R 2 , to the curren t v alue of the base register. The
oset register, R 2 , is not altered b y this op eration.
LDR R0, [R1], R2, LSL #2 First loads the 32-bit v alue at the memory address con tained in
the base register, R 1 , in to the destination register, R 0 . It will
then calculate the new v alue for the base register b y adding the
curren t v alue to the v alue obtained b y shifting the v alue in the
oset register, R 2 , left b y 2 bits. The oset register, R 2 , will
not b e eected b y this op eration.
4Instruction Set
Wh y are a micropro cessor's instructions referred to as an instruction set? Because the micropro-
cessor designer selects the instruction complemen t with great care; it m ust b e easy to execute
complex op erations as a sequence of simple ev en ts, eac h of whic h is represen ted b y one instruction
from a w ell-designed instruction set.
Assem bler often frigh ten users who are new to programming. Y et tak en in isolation, the op erations
in v olv ed in the execution of a single instruction are usually easy to follo w. F urthermore, y ou need
not attempt to understand all the instructions at once. As y ou study eac h of the programs in
these notes y ou will learn ab out the sp ecic instructions in v olv ed.
T able 4.1 lists the instruction mnemonics. This pro vides a surv ey of the pro cessors capabilities,
and will also b e useful when y ou need a certain kind of op eration but are either unsure of the
sp ecic mnemonics or not y et familiar with what instructions are a v ailable.
The app endix A giv es a detailed description of the individual instructions while c hapters 7 through
to 15 pro vide a discussion on ho w to use them.
The ARM instruction set can b e divided in to six broad classes of instruction.
• Data Mo v emen t • Logical and Bit Manipulation
• Arithmetic • Flo w Con trol
• Memory A ccess • System Con trol / Privileged
Before w e lo ok at eac h of these groups in a little more detail there are a few ideas whic h b elong

The ARM instruction set can b e divided in to six broad classes of instruction:

4.0.4 Branc h instructions
As w ell as allo wing man y data-pro cessing or load instructions to c hange con trol o w b y writing
the PC, a standard Branc h instruction is pro vided with a 24-bit signed oset, allo wing forw ard
and bac kw ard branc hes of up to 32MB.
There is a Branc h and Link (BL) option that also preserv es the address of the instruction after
the branc h in R14, the LR. This pro vides a subroutine call whic h can b e returned from b y cop ying
the LR in to the PC.
4.0.5 Data-pro cessing instructions
The data-pro cessing instructions p erform calculations on the general-purp ose registers. There are
four t yp es of data-pro cessing instructions:
• Arithmetic/logic instructions
• Comparison instructions
• Multiply instructions
• Coun t Leading Zeros instruction
Arithmetic/logic instructions
There are t w elv e arithmetic/logic instructions whic h share a common instruction format. These
p erform an arithmetic or logical op eration on up to t w o source op erands, and write the result to a
destination register. They can also optionally up date the condition co de ags based on the result.
Of the t w o source op erands:
• one is alw a ys a register
39
• the other has t w o basic forms:
 an immediate v alue
 a register v alue, optionally shifted.
If the op erand is a shifted register, the shift amoun t can b e either an immediate v alue or the
v alue of another register. F our t yp es of shift can b e sp ecied. Ev ery arithmetic/logic instruction
can therefore p erform an arithmetic/logic and a shift op eration. As a result, ARM do es not ha v e
dedicated shift instructions.
Because the Pr o gr am Counter (PC) is a general-purp ose register, arithmetic/logic instructions
can write their results directly to the PC. This allo ws easy implemen tation of a v ariet y of jump
instructions.
Comparison instructions
There are four comparison instructions whic h use the same instruction format as the arith-
metic/logic instructions. These p erform an arithmetic or logical op eration on t w o source op erands,
but do not write the result to a register. They alw a ys up date the condition ags based on the
result.
The source op erands of comparison instructions tak e the same forms as those of arithmetic/logic
instructions, including the abilit y to incorp orate a shift op eration.
Multiply instructions
Multiply instructions come in t w o classes. Both t yp es m ultiply t w o 32-bit register v alues and store
their result:
32-bit result Normal. Stores the 32-bit result in a register.
64-bit result Long. Stores the 64-bit result in t w o separate registers.
Both t yp es of m ultiply instruction can optionally p erform an accum ulate op eration.
Coun t Leading Zeros instruction
The Coun t Leading Zeros (CLZ) instruction determines the n um b er of zero bits at the most
signican t end of a register v alue, up to the rst 1 bit. This n um b er is written to the destination
register of the CLZ instruction.
4.0.6 Status register transfer instructions
The status register transfer instructions transfer the con ten ts of the CPSR or an SPSR to or from
a general-purp ose register. W riting to the CPSR can:
• set the v alues of the condition co de ags
• set the v alues of the in terrupt enable bits
• set the pro cessor mo de
40 CHAPTER 4. INSTR UCTION SET
4.0.7 Load and store instructions
The follo wing load and store instructions are a v ailable:
• Load and Store Register
• Load and Store Multiple registers
• Sw ap register and memory con ten ts
Load and Store Register
Load Register instructions can load a 32-bit w ord, a 16-bit halfw ord or an 8-bit b yte from memory
in to a register. Byte and halfw ord loads can b e automatically zero-extended or sign-extended as
they are loaded.
Store Register instructions can store a 32-bit w ord, a 16-bit halfw ord or an 8-bit b yte from a
register to memory .
Load and Store Register instructions ha v e three primary addressing mo des, all of whic h use a b ase
r e gister and an oset sp ecied b y the instruction:
• In oset addr essing , the memory address is formed b y adding or subtracting an oset to or
from the base register v alue.
• In pr e-indexe d addr essing , the memory address is formed in the same w a y as for oset
addressing. As a side-eect, the memory address is also written bac k to the base register.
• In p ost-indexe d addr essing , the memory address is the base register v alue. As a side-eect,
an oset is added to or subtracted from the base register v alue and the result is written bac k
to the base register.
In eac h case, the oset can b e either an immediate or the v alue of an index r e gister . Register-based
osets can also b e scaled with shift op erations.
As the PC is a general-purp ose register, a 32-bit v alue can b e loaded directly in to the PC to
p erform a jump to an y address in the 4GB memory space.
Load and Store Multiple registers
Load Multiple (LDM) and Store Multiple (STM) instructions p erform a blo c k transfer of an y
n um b er of the general-purp ose registers to or from memory . F our addressing mo des are pro vided:
• pre-incremen t
• p ost-incremen t
• pre-decremen t
• p ost-decremen t
The base address is sp ecied b y a register v alue, whic h can b e optionally up dated after the
transfer. As the subroutine return address and PC v alues are in general-purp ose registers, v ery
ecien t subroutine en try and exit sequences can b e constructed with LDM and STM :
41
• A single STM instruction at subroutine en try can push register con ten ts and the return address
on to the stac k, up dating the stac k p oin ter in the pro cess.
• A single LDM instruction at subroutine exit can restore register con ten ts from the stac k, load
the PC with the return address, and up date the stac k p oin ter.
LDM and STM instructions also allo w v ery ecien t co de for blo c k copies and similar data mo v emen t
algorithms.
Sw ap register and memory con ten ts
A sw ap ( SWP ) instruction p erforms the follo wing sequence of op erations:
1. It loads a v alue from a register-sp ecied memory lo cation.
2. It stores the con ten ts of a register to the same memory lo cation.
3. It writes the v alue loaded in step 1 to a register.
By sp ecifying the same register for steps 2 and 3, the con ten ts of a memory lo cation and a register
are in terc hanged.
The sw ap op eration p erforms a sp ecial indivisible bus op eration that allo ws atomic up date of
semaphores. Both 32-bit w ord and 8-bit b yte semaphores are supp orted.
4.0.8 Copro cessor instructions
There are three t yp es of copro cessor instructions:
Data-pro cessing instructions These start a copro cessor-sp ecic in ternal op eration.
Data transfer instructions These transfer copro cessor data to or from memory . The address
of the transfer is calculated b y the ARM pro cessor.
Register transfer instructions These allo w a copro cessor v alue to b e transferred to or from an
ARM register.
4.0.9 Exception-generating instructions
T w o t yp es of instruction are designed to cause sp ecic exceptions to o ccur.
Soft w are in terrupt instructions SWI instructions cause a soft w are in terrupt exception to o c-
cur. These are normally used to mak e calls to an op erating system, to request an OS-dened
service. The exception en try caused b y a SWI instruction also c hanges to a privileged pro ces-
sor mo de. This allo ws an unprivileged task to gain access to privileged functions, but only
in w a ys p ermitted b y the OS.
Soft w are breakp oin t instructions BKPT instructions cause an ab ort exception to o ccur. If
suitable debugger soft w are is installed on the ab ort v ector, an ab ort exception generated in
this fashion is treated as a breakp oin t. If debug hardw are is presen t in the system, it can
instead treat a BKPT instruction directly as a breakp oin t, prev en ting the ab ort exception
from o ccurring.

In addition to the ab o v e, the follo wing t yp es of instruction cause an Undened Instruction excep-
tion to o ccur:
• copro cessor instructions whic h are not recognized b y an y hardw are copro cessor
• most instruction w ords that ha v e not y et b een allo cated a meaning as an ARM instruction.
In eac h case, this exception is normally used either to generate a suitable error or to initiate
soft w are em ulation of the instruction.
4.0.10 Conditional Execution: /angbracketleft c c/angbracketright
Almost all ARM instructions con tain a c ondition eld whic h allo ws it to b e executed conditionally
dep enden t on the condition co de ags (3.3 on page 28). If the ags indicate that the corresp onding
condition is true when the instruction starts executing, it executes normally . Otherwise, the
instruction do es nothing.
T able 4.2 sho ws a list of the condition co des and their mnemonics. T o indicate that an instruction
is conditional w e simply place the mnemonic for the condition co de after the mnemonic for the
instruction. If no condition co de mnemonic is used the instruction will alw a ys b e executed.
F or example the follo wing instruction will mo v e the v alue of the register R 1 in to the R 0 register
only when the Carry ag has b een set, R 0 will remain unaected if the C ag w as clear.
MOVCS R0, R1
Note that the Gr e ater and the L ess conditions are for use with signed n um b ers while the Higher
and L ower conditions are for use with unsigned n um b ers. These condition co des only really mak e
seance after a comparison ( CMP ) instruction, see A.5 on page 129.
Most data-pro cessing instructions can also up date the condition co des according to their result.
Placing an  S  after the mnemonic will cause the ags to b e up dated. F or example there are t w o
v ersions of the MOV instruction:
MOV R0, #0 Will mo v e the v alue 0 in to the register R 0 without setting the ags.
MOVS R0, #0 Will do the same, mo v e the v alue 0 in to the register R 0 , but it will also set
the condition co de ags accordingly , the Zero ag will b e set, the Negativ e ag
will b e reset and the Carry and oV ero w ags will not b e eected.
If an instruction has this abilit y w e denote it using /angbracketleft S/angbracketright in our description of the instruction. The
/angbracketleft S/angbracketright alw a ys comes after the /angbracketleft c c/angbracketright (conditional execution) mo dication if it is giv en. Th us the full
description of the mo v e instruction w ould b e:
43
MOV/angbracketleft c c/angbracketright/angbracketleft S/angbracketright R d ,/angbracketleft op1/angbracketright
With all this in mind what do es the follo wing co de fragmen t do?
MOVS R0, R1
MOVEQS R0, R2
MOVEQ R0, R3
The rst instruction will mo v e R 1 in to R 0 unconditionally , but it will also set the N and Z ags
accordingly . Th us the second instruction is only executed if the Z ag is set, i.e., the v alue of R 1
w as zero. If the v alue of R 1 w as not zero the instruction is skipp ed. If the second instruction is
executed it will cop y the v alue of R 2 in to R 0 and it will also set the N and Z ags according to
the v alue of R 2 . Th us the third instruction is only executed if b oth R 1 and R 2 are b oth zero.

5Addressing Modes
5.1 Data Pro cessing Op erands: /angbracketleft op1/angbracketright
The ma jorit y of the instructions relate to data pro cessing of some form. One of the op erands
to these instructions is routed through the Barrel Shifter. This means that the op erand can b e
mo died b efore it is used. This can b e v ery useful when dealing with lists, tables and other
complex data structures. W e denote instructions of this t yp e as taking one of its argumen ts from
/angbracketleft op1/angbracketright .
An/angbracketleft op1/angbracketright argumen t ma y come from one of t w o sources, a constan t v alue or a register, and b e
mo died in v e dieren t w a ys. See Chapter ?? for more detailed information.
5.1.1 Unmo died V alue
Y ou can use a v alue or a register unmo died b y simply giving the v alue or the register name. F or
example the follo wing instructions will demonstrate the t w o metho ds:
MOV R0, #1234 Will mo v e the immediate constan t v alue 1234 10 in to the register R 0
MOV R0, R1 Will mo v e the v alue in the register R 1 in to the register R 0
5.1.2 Logical Shift Left
This will tak e the v alue of a register and shift the v alue up, to w ards the most signican t bit, b y n
bits. The n um b er of bits to shift is sp ecied b y either a constan t v alue or another register. The
lo w er bits of the v alue are replaced with a zero. This is a simple w a y of p erforming a m ultiply b y
a p o w er of 2 (×2n).
MOV R0, R1, LSL #2 R 0 will b ecome the v alue of R 1 shifted left b y 2 bits. The v alue of R 1
is not c hanged.
MOV R0, R1, LSL R2 R 0 will b ecome the v alue of R 1 shifted left b y the n um b er of bits
sp ecied in the R 2 register. R 0 is the only register to c hange, b oth R 1
and R 2 are not eected b y this op eration.
If the instruction is to set the status register, the carry ag ( C ) is the last bit that w as shifted out
of the v alue.

5.1.3 Logical Shift Righ t
Logical Shift Righ t is v ery similar to Logical Shift Left except it will shift the v alue to the righ t,
to w ards the lest signican t bit, b y n bits. It will replace the upp er bits with zeros, th us pro viding
an ecien t unsigned divide b y 2nfunction (|÷2n| ). The n um b er of bits to shift ma y b e sp ecied
b y either a constan t v alue or another register.
MOV R0, R1, LSR #2 R 0 will tak e on the v alue of R 1 shifted to the righ t b y 2 bits. The
v alue of R 1 is not c hanged.
MOV R0, R1, LSR R2 As b efore R 0 will b ecome the v alue of R 1 shifted to the righ t b y the
n um b er of bits sp ecied in the R 2 register. R 1 and R 2 are not altered
b y this op eration.
If the instruction is to set the status register, the carry ag ( C ) is the last bit to b e shifted out of
the v alue.
5.1.4 Arithmetic Shift Righ t
The Arithmetic Shift Righ t is rather similar to the Logical Shift Righ t, but rather than replacing
the upp er bits with a zero, it main tains the v alue of the most signican t bit. As the most signican t
bit is used to hold the sign, this means the sign of the v alue is main tained, th us pro viding a signed
divide b y 2nop eration (÷2n).
MOV R0, R1, ASR #2 Register R 0 will b ecome the v alue of register R 1 shifted to the righ t
b y 2 bits, with the sign main tained.
MOV R0, R1, ASR R2 Register R 0 will b ecome the v alue of the register R 1 shifted to the
righ t b y the n um b er of bits sp ecied b y the R 2 register. R 1 and R 2
are not altered b y this op eration.
Giv en the distinction b et w een the Logical and Arithmetic Shift Righ t, wh y is there no Arithmetic
Shift Left op eration?
As a signed n um b er is stored in t w o's complemen t the upp er most bits hold the sign of the n um b er.
These bits can b e considered insignican t unless the n um b er is of a sucien t size to require their
use. Th us an Arithmetic Shift Left is not required as the sign is automatically preserv ed b y the
Logical Shift.
5.1.5 Rotate Righ t
In the Rotate Righ t op eration, the lest signican t bit is copied in to the carry ( C ) ag, while the
v alue of the C ag is copied in to the most signican t bit of the v alue. In this w a y none of the bits
in the v alue are lost, but are simply mo v ed from the lo w er bits to the upp er bits of the v alue.
5.2. MEMOR Y A CCESS OPERANDS: /angbracketleft OP2/angbracketright 47
MOV R0, R1, ROR #2 This will rotate the v alue of R 1 b y t w o bits. The most signican t bit
of the resulting v alue will b e the same as the least signican t bit of
the original v alue. The second most signican t bit will b e the same
as the Carry ag. In the S v ersion the Carry ag will b e set to the
second least signican t bit of the original v alue. The v alue of R 1 is
not c hanged b y this op eration.
MOV R0, R1, ROR R2 Register R 0 will b ecome the v alue of the register R 1 rotated to the
righ t b y the n um b er of bits sp ecied b y the R 2 register. R 1 and R 2
are not altered b y this op eration.
Wh y is there no corresp onding Rotate Left op eration?
An A dd With Carry ( ADC , A.1 on page 127) to a zero v alue pro vides this service for a single bit.
The designers of the instruction set b eliev e that a Rotate Left b y more than one bit w ould nev er
b e required, th us they ha v e not pro vided a R OL function.
5.1.6 Rotate Righ t Extended
This is similar to a Rotate Righ t b y one bit. The extende d section of the fact that this function
mo v es the v alue of the Carry ( C ) ag in to the most signican t bit of the v alue, and the least
signican t bit of the v alue in to the Carry ( C ) ag. Th us it allo ws the Carry ag to b e propagated
though m ulti-w ord v alues, thereb y allo wing v alues larger than 32-bits to b e used in calculations.
MOV R0, R1 RRX The register R 0 b ecome the same as the v alue of the register R 1 rotated
though the carry ag b y one bit. The most signican t bit of the v alue
b ecomes the same as the curren t Carry ag, while the Carry ag will b e the
same as the least signican t bit or R 1 . The v alue of R 1 will not b e c hanged.
5.2 Memory A ccess Op erands: /angbracketleft op2/angbracketright
The memory address used in the memory access instructions ma y also mo died b y the barrel
shifter. This pro vides for more adv anced access to memory whic h is particularly useful when
dealing with more adv anced data structures. It allo ws pre- and p ost-incremen t instructions that
up date memory p oin ters as a side eect of the instruction. This mak es lo ops whic h pass though
memory more ecien t. W e denote instructions of this t yp e as taking one of its argumen ts from
/angbracketleft op2/angbracketright . F or a full discussion of the /angbracketleft op2/angbracketright addressing mo de w e refer the reader to Chapter ?? on
page ?? .
There are three main metho ds of sp ecifying a memory address ( /angbracketleft op2/angbracketright ), all of whic h include an
oset v alue of some form. This oset can b e sp ecied in one of three w a ys:
Constan t V alue
An immediate constan t v alue can b e pro vided. If no oset is sp ecied an immediate constan t
v alue of zero is assumed.
Register
The oset can b e sp ecied b y another register. The v alue of the register is added to the
address held in another register to form the nal address.
48 CHAPTER 5. ADDRESSING MODES
Scaled
The oset is sp ecied b y another register whic h can b e scaled b y one of the shift op erators
used for/angbracketleft op1/angbracketright . More sp ecically b y the Logical Shift Left ( LSL ), Logical Shift Righ t ( LSR ),
Arithmetic Shift Righ t ( ASR ), R Otate Righ t ( ROR ) or Rotate Righ t Extended ( RRX ) shift
op erators, where the n um b er of bits to shift is sp ecied as a constan t v alue.
5.2.1 Oset A ddressing
In oset addr essing the memory address is formed b y adding (or subtracting) an oset to or from
the v alue held in a base register.
LDR R0, [R1] Will load the register R 0 with the 32-bit w ord at the memory
address held in the register R 1 . In this instruction there is no
oset sp ecied, so an oset of zero is assumed. The v alue of
R 1 is not c hanged in this instruction.
LDR R0, [R1, #4] Will load the register R 0 with the w ord at the memory ad-
dress calculated b y adding the constan t v alue 4 to the memory
address con tained in the R 1 register. The register R 1 is not
c hanged b y this instruction.
LDR R0, [R1, R2] Loads the register R 0 with the v alue at the memory address
calculated b y adding the v alue in the register R 1 to the v alue
held in the register R 2 . Both R 1 and R 2 are not altered b y
this op eration.
LDR R0, [R1, R2, LSL #2] Will load the register R 0 with the 32-bit v alue at the memory
address calculated b y adding the v alue in the R 1 register to the
v alue obtained b y shifting the v alue in R 2 left b y 2 bits. Both
registers, R 1 and R 2 are not eected b y this op eration.
This is particularly useful for indexing in to a complex data structure. The start of the data
structure is held in a b ase register, R 1 in this case, and the oset to access a particular eld within
the structure is then added to the base address. Placing the oset in a register allo ws it to b e
calculated at run time rather than xed. This allo ws for lo oping though a table.
A scaled v alue can also b e used to access a particular item of a table, where the size of the item
is a p o w er of t w o. F or example, to lo cate item 7 in a table of 32-bit v alues w e need only shift the
index v alue 6 left b y 2 bits ( 6×22) to calculate the v alue w e need to add as an oset to the start
of the table held in a register, R 1 in our example. Remem b er that the computer coun t from zero,
th us w e use an index v alue of 6 rather than 7. A 32-bit n um b er requires 4 b ytes of storage whic h
is22, th us w e only need a 2-bit left shift.
5.2. MEMOR Y A CCESS OPERANDS: /angbracketleft OP2/angbracketright 49
5.2.2 Pre-Index A ddressing
In pr e-index addr essing the memory address if formed in the same w a y as for oset addressing.
The address is not only used to access memory , but the base register is also mo died to hold
the new v alue. In the ARM system this is kno wn as a write-b ack and is denoted b y placing a
exclamation mark after at the end of the /angbracketleft op2/angbracketright co de.
Pre-Index address can b e particularly useful in a lo op as it can b e used to automatically incremen t
or decremen t a coun ter or memory p oin ter.
LDR R0, [R1, #4]! Will load the register R 0 with the w ord at the memory address
calculated b y adding the constan t v alue 4 to the memory ad-
dress con tained in the R 1 register. The new memory address
is placed bac k in to the base register, register R 1 .
LDR R0, [R1, R2]! Loads the register R 0 with the v alue at the memory address
calculated b y adding the v alue in the register R 1 to the v alue
held in the register R 2 . The oset register, R 2 , is not altered
b y this op eration, the register holding the base address, R 1 ,
is mo died to hold the new address.
LDR R0, [R1, R2, LSL #2]! First calculates the new address b y adding the v alue in the
base address register, R 1 , to the v alue obtained b y shifting
the v alue in the oset register, R 2 , left b y 2 bits. It will then
load the 32-bit at this address in to the destination register, R 0 .
The new address is also written bac k in to the base register, R 1 .
The oset register, R 2 , will not b e eected b y this op eration.
5.2.3 P ost-Index A ddressing
In p ost-index addr ess the memory address is the base register v alue. As a side-eect, an oset
is added to or subtracted from the base register v alue and the result is written bac k to the base
register.
P ost-index addressing uses the v alue of the base register without mo dication. It then applies the
mo dication to the address and writes the new address bac k in to the base register. This can b e
used to automatically incremen t or decremen t a memory p oin ter after it has b een used, so it is
p oin ting to the next lo cation to b e used.
50 CHAPTER 5. ADDRESSING MODES
As the instruction m ust preform a write-bac k w e do not need to include an exclamation mark.
Rather w e mo v e the closing brac k et to include only the base register, as that is the register holding
the memory address w e are going to access.
LDR R0, [R1], #4 Will load the register R 0 with the w ord at the memory address
con tained in the base register, R 1 . It will then calculate the
new v alue of R 1 b y adding the constan t v alue 4 to the curren t
v alue of R 1 .
LDR R0, [R1], R2 Loads the register R 0 with the v alue at the memory address
held in the base register, R 1 . It will then calculate the new
v alue for the base register b y adding the v alue in the oset
register, R 2 , to the curren t v alue of the base register. The
oset register, R 2 , is not altered b y this op eration.
LDR R0, [R1], R2, LSL #2 First loads the 32-bit v alue at the memory address con tained in
the base register, R 1 , in to the destination register, R 0 . It will
then calculate the new v alue for the base register b y adding the
curren t v alue to the v alue obtained b y shifting the v alue in the
oset register, R 2 , left b y 2 bits. The oset register, R 2 , will
not b e eected b y this op eration.
6Programs
The only w a y to learn assem bly language programming is through exp erience. Throughout the rest
of this b o ok eac h c hapter will in tro duce v arious asp ects of assem bly programming. The c hapter
will start with a general discussion, then mo v e on to a n um b er of example programs whic h will
demonstrate the topic under discussion. The c hapter will end with a n um b er of programming
problems for y ou to try .
6.1 Example Programs
Eac h of the program examples con tains sev eral parts:
Title that describ es the general problem
Purp ose statemen t of purp ose that describ es the task the program p erforms
and the memory lo cations used.
Problem A sample problem complete with data and results.
Algorithm if the program logic is complex.
Source co de for the assem bly program.
Notes Explanatry notes that discusses the instructions and metho ds used
in the program.
Eac h example is written and assem bled as a stand-alone program. They can b e do wnloaded from
the w eb site1.
6.1.1 Program Listing F ormat
The examples in the b o ok are the actual source co de used to generate the programs. Sometimes
y ou ma y need to use the listing output of the ARM assem bler (the .list le), and in an y case y ou
should b e a w are of the fact that y ou can generate a listing le. See the section on the ARMulator
en vironmen t whic h follo ws for details of ho w to generate a .list listing le.
6.1.2 Guidelines for Examples
W e ha v e used the follo wing guidelines in construction of the examples:
1. Standard ARM assem bler notation is used, as summarized in Chapter 2.
2. The forms in whic h data and addresses app ear are selected for clarit y rather than for con-
sistency . W e use hexadecimal n um b ers for memory addresses, instruction co des, and BCD
data; decimal for n umeric constan ts; binary for logical masks; and ASCI I for c haracters.

52 CHAPTER 6. PR OGRAMS
3. F requen tly used instructions and programming tec hniques are emphasized.
4. Examples illustrate tasks that micropro cessors p erform in comm unication, instrumen tation,
computers, business equipmen t, industrial, and military applications.
5. Detailed commen ts are included.
6. Simple and clear structures are emphasised, but programs are written as ecien tly as p ossible
within this guideline. Notes accompan ying programs often describ e more ecien t pro cedures.
7. Program are written as an indep enden t pro cedures or subroutines although no assumptions
are made concerning the state of the micropro cessor on en try to the pro cedure.
8. Program end with a SWI &11 (Soft w are In terrupt) instruction. Y ou ma y prefer to mo dify
this b y replacing the SWI &11 instruction with an endless lo op instruction suc h as:
HERE BAL HERE
9. Programs use standard ARM assem bler directiv es. W e in tro duced assem bler directiv es con-
ceptually in Chapter 2. When rst examining programming examples, y ou can ignore the
assem bler directiv es if y ou do not understand them. Assem bler directiv es do not con tribute
to program logic, whic h is what y ou will b e trying to understand initially; but they are a nec-
essary part of ev ery assem bly language program, so y ou will ha v e to learn ho w to use them
b efore y ou write an y executable programs. Including assem bler directiv es in all program
examples will help y ou b ecome familiar with the functions they p erform.
6.2 T rying the examples
T o test one of the example programs, rst obtain a cop y of the source co de. The b est w a y of doing
this is to t yp e in the source co de presen ted in this b o ok, as this will help y ou to understand the
co de. Alternativ ely y ou can do wnload the source from the w eb site, although y ou w on't gain the
same kno wledge of the co de.
Go to the start men u and call up the Arm ulate program. Next op en the source le using the
normal File | Op en men u option. This will op en y our program source in a separate windo w
within the Arm ulate en vironmen t.
The next step is to create a new Pro ject within the en vironmen t. Select the Pro ject men u option,
then New. Giv e y our pro ject the same name as the source le that y ou are using (there is no
need to use a le extension  it will automatically b e sa v ed as a .apj le).
Once y ou ha v e giv en the le a name, a further dialog will op en as sho wn in the gure 6.1 on the
next page.
Clic k the A dd button, and y ou will again b e presen ted with a le dialog, whic h will displa y the
source les in the curren t directory . Select the relev an t source le and OK the dialog. Y ou will
b e returned to the previous dialog, but y ou will see no w that y our source le is included in the
pro ject. OK the Edit Pro ject dialog, and y ou will b e returned to the Arm ulate en vironmen t,
no w with t w o windo ws op en within it, one for the source co de and one for the pro ject.
W e recommend that y ou alw a ys create a .list listing le for eac h pro ject that y ou create. Do
this b y selecting the Options men u with the pro ject windo w in fo cus, then the Assem bler item.
This will op en the dialog sho wn in gure 6.2 on the facing page.
En ter -list [yourfilename].list in to the Other text b o x and OK the dialog.
Y ou ha v e no w created y our pro ject and are ready to assem ble and debug y our co de.
A dditional information on the Arm ulator is a v ailable via the help men u item.
6.3. TR YING THE EXAMPLES FR OM THE COMMAND LINE 53
Figure 6.1: New Pro ject Dialog
Figure 6.2: Assem bler Options Dialog
6.3 T rying the examples from the command line
When dev eloping the example programs, w e found the Arm ulate en vironmen t to o clumsy . W e
used the T extP ad editor and assem bled the programs from the command line. The Arm ulate
en vironmen t pro vides commands for use from the command line:
1. Assem bler
The command line assem bler is used to create an ob ject le from the program source co de.
During the dev elopmen t of the add program (program 7.3a) w e used the command line:
ARMASM -LI -CPU ARM6 -g -list add.list add.s
2. Link er
It is necessary to p osition the program at a xed lo cation in memory . This is done using the
link er. In our add example w e used the command:
ARMLINK -o add add.o
Whic h resolv es the relativ e addresses in the add.o le, pro ducing the add load image.
3. Debugger
Finally it is necessary to debug the load image. This can b e done in one of t w o w a ys, using
a command line debugger or the windo ws debugger. In either case they require a load image
( add in our example). T o use the command line debugger (kno wn as the source debugger)
the follo wing command is used:
ARMSD add
Ho w ev er, the command driv en nature of this system is confusing and hard to use for ev en
the most exp erienced of dev elop ers. Th us w e suggest y ou use the windo ws based debugger
program:
54 CHAPTER 6. PR OGRAMS
WINDBG add
Whic h will pro vide y ou with the same debugger y ou w ould ha v e seen had y ou used the
Windo w based Arm ulate en vironmen t.
6.3.1 Setting up T extP ad
T o set up this en vironmen t simply do wnload the T extP ad editor and the ARM Assem bler syn tax
le. Y ou can do wnload the editor from the do wnload page of the T extP ad w eb site2.
Do wnload Derek La w's ARM Assem bler Syn tax Denition le from the T extP ad w eb site. Y ou
can nd this under the Syntax Denition sub-section of the A dd-ons section of the Downlo ad page.
Unpac k the armasm.syn from the arm.zip le in to the T extP ad Samples directory .
Ha ving installed the Syn tax Denitions y ou should no w add a new Do cumen t Class to T extP ad.
Run T extP ad and select the New Do cument Class. . . wizard from the Congure men u. The wizard
will no w tak e y ou though the follo wing steps:
1. The Do cumen t Class requires a name. W e ha v e used the name  ARM Assembler .
2. The Class Mem b ers, the le name extension to asso ciate with this do cumen t class. W e
asso ciate all .s and .list les with this class:  *.s,*.list 
3. Syn tax Highligh ting. The next dialog is where w e tell T extP ad to use syn tax highligh ting,
simply c hec k the Enable Syn tax Highligh ting b o x. W e no w need to tell it whic h syn tax
denition le to use. If the armasm.syn le w as placed in the Samples directory , this will
app ear in the drop do wn list, and should b e selected.
While this will create the new do cumen t class, y ou will almost certainly w an t to c hange the colour
settings for this do cumen t class. This class uses the dieren t lev els of Keyw ord colouring for
dieren t asp ects of the syn tax as follo ws:
Keyw ords 1 Instructions
Keyw ords 2 Co-pro cessor and pseudo-instructions
Keyw ords 3 Shift-addresses and logical directiv es
Keyw ords 4 Registers
Keyw ords 5 Directiv es
Keyw ords 6 Argumen ts and built-in names
Y ou will probably w an t to set the color ( sic ) setting for all of these t yp es to the same settings.
W e ha v e set all but Keyw ords 2 to the same colour sc heme. T o alter the color setting y ou should
select the Preferences. . . option from the Congure men u.
In the Preference dialog (sho wn in gure 6.4 on the next page), op en the Do cument Classes
section and then y our new do cumen t class ( ARM Assembler ). No w y ou should select the colo rs
section. This will no w allo w y ou to c hange the colours for an y of the giv en color settings.
Finally y ou ma y lik e to consider adding a File T yp e Filter to the Op en File dialog. This
can b e done b y selecting the File T yp e Filter en try in the Preference dialog. Simply clic k on the
New button, add the description (ARM Assem bler (*.s, *.list)) and wildcard (*.s;*.list) details.
Finally clic k on the OK button.
Note the use of a comma to sep erate the wildcards in the description, and the use of a semi-colon
(without spaces) in the wildcard en try .

6.4. PR OGRAM INITIALIZA TION 55
Figure 6.3: T extP ad Colour Preferences Dialog
Figure 6.4: T extP ad File Name Filters Preferences Dialog
6.4 Program Initialization
All of the programming examples presen ted in these notes pa y particular atten tion to the correct
initialization of constan ts and op erands. Often this requires additional instructions that ma y
app ear sup eruous, in that they do not con tribute directly to the solution of the stated problem.
Nev ertheless, correct initialization is imp ortan t in order to ensure the prop er execution of the
program ev ery time.
W e w an t to stress correct initialization; that is wh y w e are going to emphasize this asp ect of
problems.
6.5 Sp ecial Conditions
F or the same reasons that w e pa y particular atten tion to sp ecial conditions that can cause a pro-
gram to fail. Empt y lists and zero indexes are t w o of the most common circumstances o v erlo ok ed
in sample problems. It is critically imp ortan t when using micropro cessors that y ou learn with y our
v ery rst program to an ticipate un usual circumstances; they frequen tly cause y our program to fail.
Y ou m ust build in the necessary programming steps to accoun t for these p oten tial problems.
6.6 Problems
Eac h c hapter will no w end with a n um b er of programming problems for y our to try . They ha v e
b een pro vided to help y ou understand the ideas presen ted in the c hapter. Y ou should use the
56 CHAPTER 6. PR OGRAMS
programming examples as guidelines for solving the problems. Don't forget to run y our solutions
on the ARMulator to ensure that they are correct.
The follo wing guidelines will help in solving the problems:
1. Commen t eac h program so that others can understand it. The commen ts can b e brief and
ungrammatical. They should explain the purp ose of a section or instruction in the program,
but should not describ e the op eration of instructions, that description is a v ailable in man uals.
F or example the follo wing line:
ADD R1, R1, #1
could b e giv en the commen t A dd one to R1 or Incremen t R1, b oth of whic h pro vide no
indication as to why the line is there. They tell us what the instruction is doing, but w e can
tell that b y lo oking at the instruction itself. W e are more in terested in wh y the instruction
is there. A commen t suc h as Incremen t lo op coun ter is m uc h more useful as it explains
wh y y ou are adding one to R 1 , the lo op coun ter.
Y ou do not ha v e to commen t eac h statemen t or explain the ob vious. Y ou ma y follo w the
format of the examples but pro vide less detail.
2. Emphasise clarit y , simplicit y , and go o d structure in programs. While programs should b e
reasonably ecien t, do not w orry ab out sa ving a single b yte of program memory or a few
microseconds.
3. Mak e programs reasonably general. Do not confuse parameters (suc h as the n um b er of
elemen ts in an y arra y) with xed constan ts (suc h as the co de for the letter C).
4. Nev er assume xed initial v alues for parameters.
5. Use assem bler notation as sho wn in the examples and dened in Chapter 2.
6. Use sym b olic notation for address and data references. Sym b olic notation should also b e
used ev en for constan ts (suc h as DATA_SELECT instead of 2_00000100 ). Also use the clearest
p ossible form for data (suc h as 'C' instead of 0x43 ).
7. Use meaningful names for lab els and v ariables, e.g., SUM or CHECK rather than X or Z .
8. Execute eac h program with the em ulator. There is no other w a y of ensuring that y our
program is correct. W e ha v e pro vided sample data with eac h problem. Be sure that the
program w orks for sp ecial cases.

This c hapter con tains some v ery elemen tary programs. They will in tro duce some fundamen tal
features of the ARM. In addition, these programs demonstrate some primitiv e tasks that are

This program solv es the problem in t w o simple steps. The rst instruction loads data register R 1
with the 16-bit v alue in lo cation Value . The next instruction sa v es the 16-bit con ten ts of data
register R 1 in lo cation Result .
As a reminder of the necessary elemen ts of an assem bler program for the ARMulator, notice that
this, and all the other example programs ha v e the follo wing elemen ts. Firstly there m ust b e an
ENTRY directiv e. This tells the assem bler where the rst executable instruction is lo cated. Next
there m ust b e at least one AREA directiv e, at the start of the program, and there ma y b e other
AREA directiv es to dene data storage areas. Finally there m ust b e an END directiv e, to sho w where
the co de ends. The absence of an y of these will cause the assem bly to fail with an error.
Another limitation to b ear in mind is that ARMulator instructions will only deal with BYTE (8
bits) or WORD (32 bit) data sizes. It is p ossible to declare HALF-WORD (16 bit) v ariables b y the use

of the DCW directiv e, but it is necessary to ensure consistency of storage of HALF-WORD b y the use
of the ALIGN directiv e. Y ou can see the use of this in the rst w ork ed example.
In addition, under the RISC arc hitecture of the ARM, it is not p ossible to directly manipulate
data in storage. Ev en if no actual manipulation of the data is taking place, as in this rst example,
it is necessary to use the LDR or LDRB and STR or STRB to mo v e data to a dieren t area of memory .
This v ersion of the LDR instruction mo v es the 32-bit w ord con tained in memory lo cation Value
in to a register and then stores it using the STR instruction at the memory lo cation sp ecied b y
Result .
Notice that, b y default, ev ery program is allo cated a literal p o ol (a storage area) after the last
executable line. In the case of this, and most of the other programs, w e ha v e formalised this b y
the use of the AREA Data1, DATA directiv e. Instruction on ho w to nd addresses of v ariables

This program solv es the problem in three steps. The rst instruction mo v es the con ten ts of

data register R 1 . Finally , in the third instruction the result of the logical complemen t is stored in

Note that an y data register ma y b e referenced in an y instruction that uses data registers, but note
the use of R 15 for the program coun ter, R 14 for the link register and R 13 for the stac k p oin ter.
Th us, in the LDR instruction w e'v e just illustrated, an y of the general purp ose registers could ha v e
b een used.
The LDR and STR instructions in this program, lik e those in Program 7.1, demonstrate one of
the ARM's addressing mo des. The data reference to Value as a source op erand is an example
of immediate addressing. In immediate addressing the oset to the address of the data b eing
referenced (less 8 b y es) is con tained in the extension w ord(s) follo wing the op eration w ord of the
instruction. As sho wn in the assem bly listing, the oset to the address corresp onding to Value is
found in the extension w ord for the LDR and STR instructions.

The ADD instruction in this program is an example of a three-op erand instruction. Unlik e the LDR

The ADR pseudo-instruction in tro duces a new addressing mo de  oest addressing, whic h w e
ha v e not used previously . Immediate addressing lets y ou dene a data constan t and include that
constan t in the instruction's asso ciated ob ject co de. The assem bler format iden ties immediate
addressing with a # preceding the data constan t. The size of the data constan t v aries dep ending
on the instruction. Immediate addressing is extremely useful when small data constan ts m ust b e
referenced.
The ADR pseudo-instruction could b e replaced b y the use of the instruction LDR together with the
use of the = to indicate that the address of the data should b e loaded rather than the data itself.
The second addressing mo de  oset addressing  uses immediate addressing to load a p oin ter
to a memory address in to one of the general purp ose registers.
Program 7.3b also demonstrates the use of base register plus oset addressing. In this example
w e ha v e p erformed this op eration man ually on line 10 ( ADD R0, R0, #0x4 ), whic h incremen ts the
address stored in R 0 b y 4 b ytes or one WORD . There are m uc h simpler and more ecien t w a ys of
doing this, suc h as pre-index or p ost-index addressing whic h w e will see in later examples.
Another adv an tage of this addressing mo de is its faster execution time as compared to immediate
addressing. This impro v emen t o ccurs b ecause the address extension w ord(s) do es not ha v e to b e
fetc hed from memory prior to the actual data reference, after the initial fetc h.
A nal adv an tage is the exibilit y pro vided b y ha ving R 0 hold an address instead of b eing xed as
part of the instruction. This exibilit y allo ws the same co de to b e used for more than one address.

could simply c hange the con ten ts of R 0 .

This is an example of b yte manipulation. The ARM allo ws most instructions whic h op erate on
w ords also to op erate on b ytes. Th us, b y using the B sux, all the LDR instructions in Program 7.5
b ecome LDRB instructions, therefore p erforming b yte op erations. The STR instruction m ust remain,
since w e are storing a halfwor d v alue. If w e w ere only dealing with a one b yte result, w e could use
the STRB b yte v ersion of the store instruction.
Remem b er that the MOV instruction p erforms register-to-register transfers. This use of the MOV
instruction is quite frequen t.
Generally , it is more ecien t in terms of program memory usage and execution time to minimise
references to memory .

the second 4 b ytes or the lo w er half of the 64-bit v alue from the memro y address p oin ted to b y
R 0 plus 4 b ytes ( [R0, #4] . Bet w een them R 1 and R 2 no w hold the rst 64-bit v alue, R 1 has

Next, the t w o lo w order wor d s, held in R 2 and R 4 are added, and the result stored in R 6 .
This is all straigh tforw ard, but note no w the use of the S sux to the ADD instruction. This forces

9Program Loops
The program lo op is the basic structure that forces the CPU to rep eat a sequence of instructions.
Lo ops ha v e four sections:
1. The initialisation section, whic h establishes the starting v alues of coun ters, p oin ters, and
other v ariables.
2. The pro cessing section, where the actual data manipulation o ccurs. This is the section that
do es the w ork.
3. The lo op con trol section, whic h up dates coun ters and p oin ters for the next iteration.
4. The concluding section, that ma y b e needed to analyse and store the results.
The computer p erforms Sections 1 and 4 only once, while it ma y p erform Sections 2 and 3 man y
times. Therefore, the execution time of the lo op dep ends mainly on the execution time of Sections
2 and 3. Those sections should execute as quic kly as p ossible, while the execution times of Sections
1 and 4 ha v e less eect on o v erall program sp eed.
There are t ypically t w o metho ds of programming a lo op, these are

alw a ys executing the pro cessing section of the lo op at least once.
On the other hand, the computer ma y not execute the pro cessing
section of the while lo op at all. The rep eat-un til lo op is more
natural, but the while lo op is often more ecien t and eliminates
the problem of going through the pro cessing sequence once ev en
where there is no data for it to handle.
The computer can use the lo op structure to pro cess large sets of

Rep eatdata (usually called arra ys). The simplest w a y to use one se-
quence of instructions to handle an arra y of data is to ha v e the
program incremen t a register (usually an index register or stac k
p oin ter) after eac h iteration. Then the register will con tain the
address of the next elemen t in the arra y when the computer re-
p eats the sequence of instructions. The computer can then handle
arra ys of an y length with a single program.
Register indirect addressing is the k ey to the pro cessing arra ys since it allo ws y ou to v ary the
actual address of the data (the  ee ctive addr ess ) b y c hanging the con ten ts of a register. The
autoincremen ting mo de is particularly con v enien t for pro cessing arra ys since it automatically up-
dates the register for the next iteration. No additional instruction is necessary . Y ou can ev en ha v e
an automatic incremen t b y 2 or 4 if the arra y con tains 16-bit or 32-bit data or addresses.
Although our examples sho w the pro cessing of arra ys with autoincremen ting (adding 1, 2, or 4 after
eac h iteration), the pro cedure is equally v alid with auto decremen ting (subtracting 1, 2, or 4 b efore
eac h iteration). Man y programmers nd mo ving bac kw ard through an arra y somewhat a wkw ard

not kno w bac kw ard from forw ard. The programmer, ho w ev er, m ust remem b er that the pro cessor
incremen ts an address register after using it but decremen ts an address register b efore using it.
This dierence aects initialisation as follo ws:
1. When mo ving forw ard through an arra y (autoincremen ting), start the register p oin ting to
the lo w est address o ccupied b y the arra y .
2. When mo ving bac kw ard through an arra y (auto decremen ting), start the register p oin ting

9.2.1 Chec ksum of data
Calculate the c hec ksum of a series of 8-bit n um b ers. The length of the series is dened b y the
v ariable LENGTH . The lab el START indicates the start of the table. Store the c hec ksum in the
v ariable CHECKSUM . The c hec ksum is formed b y adding all the n um b ers in the list, ignoring the
carry o v er (or o v ero w).
Note: Chec ksums are often used to ensure that data has b een correctly read. A c hec ksum calcu-
lated when reading the data is compared to a c hec ksum that is stored with the data. If the t w o
c hec ksums do not agree, the system will usually indicate an error, or automatically read the data
again.

10 Strings
Micropro cessors often handle data whic h represen ts prin ted c haracters rather than n umeric quan-
tities. Not only do k eyb oards, prin ters, comm unications devices, displa ys, and computer terminals
exp ect or pro vide c haracter-co ded data, but man y instrumen ts, test systems, and con trollers also
require data in this form. ASCI I (American Standard Co de for Information In terc hange) is the
most commonly used co de, but others exist.
W e use the standard sev en-bit ASCI I c haracter co des, as sho wn in T able 10.1; the c haracter co de
o ccupies the lo w-order sev en bits of the b yte, and the most signican t bit of the b yte holds a 0 or
a parit y bit.
10.1 Handling data in ASCI I
Here are some principles to remem b er in handling ASCI I-co ded data:
• The co des for the n um b ers and letters form ordered sequences. Since the ASCI I co des for
the c haracters  0  through  9  are 30 16 through 39 16 y ou can con v ert a decimal digit to the
equiv alen t ASCI I c haracters (and ASCI I to decimal) b y simple adding the ASCI I oset: 30 16
= ASCI I  0 . Since the co des for letters (41 16 through 5A 16 and 61 16 through 7A 16 ) are in
order, y ou can alphab etises strings b y sorting them according to their n umerical v alues.
• The computer do es not distinguish b et w een prin ting and non-prin ting c haracters. Only the
I/0 devices mak e that distinction.
• An ASCI I I/0 device handles data only in ASCI I. F or example, if y ou w an t an ASCI I prin ter
to prin t the digit  7 , y ou m ust send it 37 16 as the data; 07 16 will ring the b ell. Similarly ,
if a user presses the  9  k ey on an ASCI I k eyb oard, the input data will b e 39 16 ; 09 16 is the
tab k ey .
• Man y ASCI I devices do not use the en tire c haracter set. F or example, devices ma y ignore
man y con trol c haracters and ma y not prin t lo w er-case letters.
• Despite the denition of the con trol c haracters man y devices in terpret them dieren tly . F or
example they t ypically uses con trol c haracters in a sp ecial w a y to pro vide features suc h as
cursor con trol on a displa y , and to allo w soft w are con trol of c haracteristics suc h as rate of
data transmission, prin t width, and line length.
• Some widely used ASCI I con trol c haracters are:
0A16 LF line feed
0D16 CR carriage return
0816 BS bac kspace
7F16 DEL rub out or delete c haracter

T able 10.1: Hexadecimal ASCI I Character Co des
• Eac h ASCI I c haracter o ccupies eigh t bits. This allo ws a large c haracter set but is w asteful
when only a few c haracters are actually b eing used. If, for example, the data consists en tirely
of decimal n um b ers, the ASCI I format (allo wing one digit p er b yte) requires t wice as m uc h
storage, comm unications capacit y , and pro cessing time as the BCD format (allo wing t w o
digits p er b yte).
The assem bler includes a feature to mak e c haracter-co ded data easy to handle, single quotation
marks around a c haracter indicate the c haracter's ASCI I v alue. F or example,
MOV R3, #'A'
is the same as
MOV R3, #0x41
The rst form is preferable for sev eral reasons. It increases the readabilit y of the instruction, it
also a v oids errors that ma y result from lo oking up a v alue in a table. The program do es not
dep end on ASCI I as the c haracter set, since the assem bler handles the con v ersion using whatev er
co de has b een designed for.
10.2 A string of c haracters
Individual c haracters on there o wn are not really all that helpful. As h umans w e need a string
of c haracters in order to form meaningful text. In assem bly programming it is normal to ha v e
to pro cess one c haracter at a time. Ho w ev er, the assem bler do es at least allo w us to store a
string of b y es (c haracters) in a friendly manner with the DCB directiv e. F or example, line 26 of
program 10.1a is:
DCB "Hello, World", CR
whic h will pro duce the follo wing binary data:
10.2. A STRING OF CHARA CTERS 81
Binary: 48 65 6C 6C 6F 2C 20 57 6F 72 6C 64 0D
T ext: H e l l o , SP W o r l d CR
Use table 10.1 to c hec k that this is correct. In order to mak e the program just that little bit more
readable, line 5 denes the lab el CR to ha v e the v alue for a Carriage Return (0D 16 ).
There are three main metho ds for handling strings: Fixed Length, T erminated, and Coun ted. It
is normal for a high lev el language to supp ort just one metho d. C / C++ and Java all supp ort the
use of Zero-T erminated strings, while P ascal and A da use coun ted strings. Although it is p ossible
to pro vide y our o wn supp ort for the alternativ e string t yp e it is seldom done. A go o d programmer
will use a mix of metho ds dep ending of the nature of the strings concerned.
10.2.1 Fixed Length Strings
A xed length string is where the string is of a predened and xed size. F or example, in a system
where it is kno wn that all strings are going to b e ten c haracters in length, w e can simply reserv e
10 b ytes for the string.
This has an immediate adv an tages in that the managemen t of the strings is simple when compared
to the alternativ e metho ds. F or example w e only need one lab el for an arra y of strings, and w e
can calculate the starting p osition of the nthstring b y a simple m ultiplication.
This adv an tage is ho w ev er also a ma jor disadv an tage. F or example a p ersons name can b e an ything
from t w o c haracters to an y n um b er of c haracters. Although it w ould b e p ossible to reserv e sucien t
space for the longest of names this amoun t of memory w ould b e required for all names, including
the t w o letter ones. This is a signican t w aist of memory .
It w ould b e p ossible to reserv e just ten c haracters for eac h name. When a t w o letter name app ears
it w ould ha v e to b e padded out with spaces in order to mak e the name ten c haracters in length.
When a name longer than ten c haracters app ears it w ould ha v e to b e truncated do wn to just ten
c haracters th us c hopping o part of the name. This requires extra pro cessing and is not en tirely
friendly to users who happ en to ha v e a long name.
When there is little memory and all the strings are kno wn in adv ance it ma y b e a go o d idea to
use xed length strings. F or example, command driv en systems tend to use a xed length strings
for the list of commands.
10.2.2 T erminated Strings
A terminated string is one that can b e of an y length and uses a sp ecial c haracter to mark the end
of the string, this c haracter is kno wn at the sentinel . F or example program 10.1a uses the carriage
return as it's sen tinel.
Ov er the y ears sev eral dieren t sen tinels ha v e b een used, these include $ (26 16 ), EOT (End of
T ext  04 16 ), CR (Carriage Return  0D 16 ), LF (Line F eed  0A 16 ) and NUL (No c haracter 
0016 ). T o da y the most commonly used sen tinel is the NUL c haracter, primarily b ecause it is used
b y C / C++ . The NUL c haracter also has a go o d feeling ab out it, as it is represen ted b y the v alue
0, has no other meaning and it is easier to detected than an y other c haracter. This is frequen tly
referred to as a Null- or Zero-T erminated string or simply as an ASCI IZ string.
The terminated string has the adv an tage that it can b e of an y length. Pro cessing the string is
fairly simply , y ou en ter in to a lo op pro cessing eac h c haracter at a time un til y ou reac h the sen tinel.
The disadv an tage is that the sen tinel c haracter can not app ear in the string. This is another reason
wh y the NUL c haracter is suc h a go o d c hoice for the sen tinel.
82 CHAPTER 10. STRINGS
10.2.3 Coun ted Strings
A coun ted string is one in whic h the rst one or t w o b yte holds the length of the string in c haracters.
Th us a coun ted string can b e of an y n um b er of c haracters up to the largest unsigned n um b er that
can b e stored in the rst b yte/w ord.
A coun ted string ma y app ear rather clumsy at rst. Ha ving the length of the string as a binary
v alue has a distinct adv an tage o v er the terminated string. It allo w the use of the coun ting instruc-
tions that ha v e b een included in man y instruction sets. This means w e can ignore the testing for
a sen tinel c haracter and simply decremen t our coun ter, this is a far faster metho d of w orking.
T o scan through an arra y of strings w e simply p oin t to the rst string, and add the length coun t
to our p oin ter to obtain the start of the next string. F or a terminated string w e w ould ha v e to
scan for the sen tinel for eac h string.
There are t w o disadv an tages with the coun ted string. The string do es ha v e a maxim um length,
255 c haracters or 64K dep ending on the size of the coun t v alue (8- or 16-bit). Although it is
normally felt that 64K should b e sucien t for most strings. The second disadv an tage is their
p erceiv ed complexit y . Man y p eople feel that the complexit y of the coun ted string out w eighs the
sp eed adv an tage.
10.3 In ternational Characters
As computing expands outside of the English sp eaking w orld w e ha v e to pro vide supp ort for
languages other than standard American. Man y Europ ean languages use letters that are not
a v ailable in standard ASCI I, for example: ÷, ×, ø, Ø, æ, Æ, ª, , ÿ, ½, and ¾. This is particularly
imp ortan t when dealing with names: Ångstrøm, Karlstraÿe or uk asiewicz.
The ASCI I c haracter set is not ev en capable of handling English correctly . When w e b orro w a
w ord from another language w e also use it's diacritic marks (or ac c ents ). F or example I w ould
rather see pâté on a men u rather than pate. ASCI I do es not pro vide supp ort for suc h accen ts.
T o o v ercome this limitation the in ternational comm unit y has pro duced a new c haracter enco ding,
kno wn as Unic o de . In Unico de the c haracter co de is t w o b ytes long, the rst b yte indicates whic h
char acter set the c haracter comes from, while the second b yte indicates the c haracter p osition
within the c haracter set. The traditional ASCI I c haracter set is incorp orated in to Unico de as
c haracter set zero. In the revised C standard a new data t yp e of wchar w as dened to cater for
this new wide c haracter.
While Unico de is sucien t to represen t the c haracters from most mo dern languages, it is not
sucien t to represen t all the written languages of the w orld, ancien t and mo dern. Hence an
extended v ersion, kno wn as Unico de-32 is b eing dev elop ed where the c haracter set is a 23-bit
v alue (three b ytes). Unico de is a subset of Unico de-32, while ASCI I is a subset of Unico de.
Although w e do not consider Unico de y ou should b e a w are of the problem of in ternational c haracter
sets and the solution Unico de pro vides.

Determine the length of an ASCI I message. All c haracters are 7-bit ASCI I with MSB = 0. The
string of c haracters in whic h the message is em b edded has a starting address whic h is con tained
in the START v ariable. The message itself starts with an ASCI I STX (Start of T ext) c haracter

11 Code Conversion
Co de con v ersion is a con tin ual problem in micro computer applications. P eripherals pro vide data
in ASCI I, BCD or v arious sp ecial co des. The micro computer m ust con v ert the data in to some
standard form for pro cessing. Output devices ma y require data in ASCI I, BCD, sev en-segmen t or
other co des. Therefore, the micro computer m ust con v ert the results to the prop er form after it
completes the pro cessing.
There are sev eral w a ys to approac h co de con v ersion:
1. Some con v ersions can easily b e handled b y algorithms in v olving arithmetic or logical func-
tions. The program ma y , ho w ev er, ha v e to handle sp ecial cases separately .
2. More complex con v ersions can b e handled with lo okup tables. The lo okup table metho d
requires little programming and is easy to apply . Ho w ev er the table ma y o ccup y a large
amoun t of memory if the range of input v alues is large.
3. Hardw are is readily a v ailable for some con v ersion tasks. T ypical examples are deco ders
for BCD to sev en-segmen t con v ersion and Univ ersal Async hronous Receiv er/T ransmitters
(UAR T s) for con v ersion b et w een parallel and serial formats.
In most applications, the program should do as m uc h as p ossible of the co de con v ersion w ork.
Most co de con v ersions are easy to program and require little execution time.

12 Arithmetic
Muc h of the arithmetic in some micropro cessor applications consists of m ultiple-w ord binary or
decimal manipulations. The pro cessor pro vides for decimal addition and subtraction, but do es
not pro vide for decimal m ultiplication or division, y ou m ust implemen t these op erations with
sequences of instruction.
Most pro cessors pro vide for b oth signed and unsigned binary arithmetic. Signed n um b ers are
represen ted in t w o's complemen t form. This means that the op erations of addition and subtraction
are the same whether the n um b ers are signed or unsigned.
Multiple-precision binary arithmetic requires simple rep etitions of the basic instructions. The
Carry ag transfers information b et w een w ords. It is set when an addition results in a carry or
a subtraction results in a b orro w. A dd with Carry and Subtract with Carry use this information
from the previous arithmetic op eration.
Decimal arithmetic is a common enough task for micropro cessors that most ha v e sp ecial instruc-
tions for this purp ose. These instructions ma y either p erform decimal op erations directly or correct
the results of binary op erations to the prop er decimal form. Decimal arithmetic is essen tial in
suc h applications as p oin t-of-sale terminals, c hec k pro cessors, order en try systems, and banking
terminals.
Y ou can implemen t decimal m ultiplication and division as series of additions and subtractions,
resp ectiv ely . Extra storage m ust b e reserv ed for results, since a m ultiplication pro duces a result
t wice as long as the op erands. A division con tracts the length of the result. Multiplications and
divisions are time-consuming when done in soft w are b ecause of the rep eated op erations that are
necessary .

13 Tables and Lists
T ables and lists are t w o of the basic data structures used with all computers. W e ha v e already seen
tables used to p erform co de con v ersions and arithmetic. T ables ma y also b e used to iden tify or
resp ond to commands and instructions, pro vide access to les or records, dene the meaning of k eys
or switc hes, and c ho ose among alternate programs. Lists are usually less structured than tables.
Lists ma y record tasks that the pro cessor m ust p erform, messages or data that the pro cessor m ust
record, or conditions that ha v e c hanged or should b e monitored.

15 Subroutines
None of the examples that w e ha v e sho wn th us far is a t ypical program that w ould stand b y itself. Most
real programs p erform a series of tasks, man y of whic h ma y b e used a n um b er of times or b e common to
other programs.
The standard metho d of pro ducing programs whic h can b e used in this manner is to write subroutines
that p erform particular tasks. The resulting sequences of instructions can b e written once, tested once,
and then used rep eatedly .
There are sp ecial instructions for transferring con trol to subroutines and restoring con trol to the main
program. W e often refer to the sp ecial instruction that transfers con trol to a subroutine as Call, Jump, or
Brac h to a Subroutine. The sp ecial instruction that restores con trol to the main program is usually called
Return.
In the ARM the Branc h-and-Link instruction ( BL ) is used to Branc h to a Subroutine. This sa v es the
curren t v alue of the program coun ter ( PC or R 15 ) in the Link Register ( LR or R 14 ) b efore placing the
starting address of the subroutine in the program coun ter. The ARM do es not ha v e a standard Return
from Subroutine instruction lik e other pro cessors, rather the programmer should cop y the v alue in the
Link Register in to the Program Coun ter in order to return to the instruction after the Branc h-and-Link
instruction. Th us, to return from a subroutine y ou should the instruction:
MOV PC, LR
Should the subroutine wish to call another subroutine it will ha v e to sa v e the v alue of the Link Register
b efore calling the nested subroutine.
15.1 T yp es of Subroutines
Sometimes a subroutine m ust ha v e sp ecial c haracteristics.
Relo catable
The co de can b e placed an ywhere in memory . Y ou can use suc h a subroutine easily , regardless of
other programs or the arrangemen t of the memory . A relo cating loader is necessary to place the
program in memory prop erly; the loader will start the program after other programs and will add
the starting address or relo cation constan t to all addresses in the program.
P osition Indep enden t
The co de do es not require a relo cating loader  all program addresses are expressed relativ e to the
program coun ter's curren t v alue. Data addresses are held in-registers at all times. W e will discuss
the writing of p osition indep enden t co de later in this c hapter.
Reen tran t
The subroutine can b e in terrupted and called b y the in terrupting program, giving the correct results
for b oth the in terrupting and in terrupted programs. Reen tran t subroutines are required for go o d
for ev en t based systems suc h as a m ultitasking op erating system (Windo ws or Unix) and em b edded
real time en vironmen ts. It is not dicult to mak e a subroutine reen tran t. The only requiremen t is
that the subroutine uses just registers and the stac k for its data storage, and the subroutine is self
con tained in that it do es not use an y v alue dened outside of the routine (global v alues).
Recursiv e
The subroutine can call itself. Suc h a subroutine clearly m ust also b e reen tran t.

114 CHAPTER 15. SUBR OUTINES
15.2 Subroutine Do cumen tation
Most programs consist of a main program and sev eral subroutines. This is useful as y ou can use kno wn pre-
written routines when a v ailable and y ou can debug and test the other subroutines prop erly and remem b er
their exact eects on registers and memory lo cations.
Y ou should pro vide sucien t do cumen tation suc h that users need not examine the subroutine's in ternal
structure. Among necessary sp ecications are:
• A description of the purp ose of the subroutine
• A list of input and output parameters
• Registers and memory lo cations used
• A sample case, p erhaps including a sample calling sequence
The subroutine will b e easy to use if y ou follo w these guidelines.
15.3 P arameter P assing T ec hniques
In order to b e really useful, a subroutine m ust b e general. F or example, a subroutine that can p erform
only a sp ecialized task, suc h as lo oking for a particular letter in an input string of xed length, will not
b e v ery useful. If, on the other hand, the subroutine can lo ok for an y letter, in strings of an y length, it
will b e far more helpful.
In order to pro vide subroutines with this exibilit y , it is necessary to pro vide them with the abilit y to
receiv e v arious kinds of information. W e call data or addresses that w e pro vide the subroutine parameters.
An imp ortan t part of writing subroutines is pro viding for transferring the parameters to the subroutine.
This pro cess is called P arameter P assing.
There are three general approac hes to passing parameters:
1. Place the parameters in registers.
2. Place the parameters in a blo c k of memory .
3. T ransfer the parameters and results on the hardw are stac k.
The registers often pro vide a fast, con v enien t w a y of passing parameters and returning results. The
limitations of this metho d are that it cannot b e expanded b ey ond the n um b er of a v ailable registers; it
often results in unforeseen side eects; and it lac ks generalit y .
The trade-o here is b et w een fast execution time and a more general approac h. Suc h a trade-o is common
in computer applications at all lev els. General approac hes are easy to learn and consisten t; they can b e
automated through the use of macros. On the other hand, approac hes that tak e adv an tage of the sp ecic
features of a particular task require less time and memory . The c hoice of one approac h o v er the other
dep ends on y our application, but y ou should tak e the general approac h (sa ving programming time and
simplifying do cumen tation and main tenance) unless time or memory constrain ts force y ou to do otherwise.
15.3.1 P assing P arameters In Registers
The rst and simplest metho d of passing parameters to a subroutine is via the registers. After calling a
subroutine, the calling program can load memory addresses, coun ters, and other data in to registers. F or
example, supp ose a subroutine op erates on t w o data buers of equal length. The subroutine migh t sp ecify
that the length of the t w o data buers b e in the register R 0 while the staring address of the t w o data
buer are in the registers R 1 and R 2 . The calling program w ould then call the subroutine as follo ws:
MOV R0, #BufferLen ; Length of Buffer in R0
LDR R1, =BufferA ; Buffer A beginning address in R1
LDR R2, =BufferB ; Buffer B beginning address in R2
BL Subr ; Call subroutine
15.3. P ARAMETER P ASSING TECHNIQUES 115
Using this metho d of parameter passing, the subroutine can simply assume that the parameters are
there. Results can also b e returned in registers, or the addresses of lo cations for results can b e passed as
parameters via the registers. Of course, this tec hnique is limited b y the n um b er of registers a v ailable.
Pro cessor features suc h as register indirect addressing, indexed addressing, and the abilit y to use an y
register as a stac k p oin ter allo w far more p o w erful and general w a ys of passing parameters.
15.3.2 P assing P arameters In A P arameter Blo c k
P arameters that are to b e passed to a subroutine can also b e placed in to memory in a parameter blo c k.
The lo cation of this parameter blo c k can b e passed to the subroutine via a register.
LDR R0, =Params ; R0 Points to Parameter Block
BL Subr ; Call the subroutine
If y ou place the parameter blo c k immediately after the subroutine call the address of the parameter
blo c k is automatically place in to the Link Register b y the Branc h and Link instruction. The subroutine
m ust mo dify the return address in the Link Register in addition to fetc hing the parameters. Using this
tec hnique, our example w ould b e mo died as follo ws:
BL Subr
DCD BufferLen ;Buffer Length
DCD BufferA ;Buffer A starting address
DCD BufferB ;Buffer B starting address
The subroutine sa v es' prior con ten ts of CPU registers, then loads parameters and adjusts the return
address as follo ws:
Subr LDR R0, [LR], #4 ; Read BuufferLen
LDR R1, [LR], #4 ; Read address of Buffer A
LDR R2, [LR], #4 ; Read address of Buffer B
; LR points to next instruction
The addressing mo de [LR], #4 will read the v alue at the address p oin ted to b y the Link Register and then
mo v e the register on b y four b ytes. Th us at the end of this sequence the v alue of LR has b een up dated to
p oin t to the next instruction after the parameter blo c k.
This parameter passing tec hnique has the adv an tage of b eing easy to read. It has, ho w ev er, the disadv an-
tage of requiring parameters to b e xe d when the program is written. P assing the address of the parameter
blo c k in via a register allo ws the papa meters to b e c hanged as the program is running.
15.3.3 P assing P arameters On The Stac k
Another common metho d of passing parameters to a subroutine is to push the parameters on to the stac k.
Using this parameter passing tec hnique, the subroutine call illustrated ab o v e w ould o ccur as follo ws:
MOV R0, #BufferLen ; Read Buffer Length
STR R0, [SP, #-4]! ; Save on the stack
LDR R0, =BufferA ; Read Address of Buffer A
STR R0, [SP, #-4]! ; Save on the stack
LDR R0, =BufferA ; Read Address of Buffer B
STR R0, [SP, #-4]! ; Save on the stack
BL Subr
The subroutine m ust b egin b y loading parameters in to CPU registers as follo ws:
Subr STMIA R12, {R0, R1, R2, R12, R14} ; save working registers to stack
LDR R0, [R12, #0] ; Buffer Length in D0
LDR R1, [R12, #4] ; Buffer A starting address
LDR R2, [R12, #8] ; Buffer B starting address
... ; Main function of subroutine
LDMIA R12, {R0, R1, R2, R12, R14} ; Recover working registers
MOV PC, LR ; Return to caller
116 CHAPTER 15. SUBR OUTINES
In this approac h, all parameters are passed and results are returned on the stac k.
The stac k gro ws do wn w ard (to w ard lo w er addresses). This o ccurs b ecause elemen ts are pushed on to the
stac k using the pre-decremen t address mo de. The use of the pre-decremen t mo de causes the stac k p oin ter
to alw a ys con tain the address of the last o ccupied lo cation, rather than the next empt y one as on some
other micropro cessors. This implies that y ou m ust initialise the stac k p oin ter to a v alue higher than the
largest address in the stac k area.
When passing parameters on the stac k, the programmer m ust implemen t this approac h as follo ws:
1. Decremen t the system stac k p oin ter to mak e ro om for parameters on the system stac k, and store
them using osets from the stac k p oin ter, or simply push the parameters on the stac k.
2. A ccess the parameters b y means of osets from the system stac k p oin ter.
3. Store the results on the stac k b y means of osets from the systems stac k p oin ter.
4. Clean up the stac k b efore or after returning from the subroutine, so that the parameters are remo v ed
and the results are handled appropriately .
15.4 T yp es Of P arameters
Regardless of our approac h to passing parameters, w e can sp ecify the parameters in a v ariet y of w a ys. F or
example, w e can:
pass-b y-v alue
Where the actual v alues are placed in the parameter list. The name comes from the fact that it is
only the v alue of the parameter that is passed in to the subroutine rather than the parameter itself.
This is the metho d used b y most high lev el programming languages.
pass-b y-reference
The address of the parameters are placed in the parameter list. The subroutine can access the v alue
directly rather than a cop y of the parameter. This is m uc h more dangerous as the subroutine can
c hange a v alue y ou don't w an t it to.
pass-b y-name
Rather than passing either the v alue or a reference to the v alue a string con taining the name of the
parameter is passed. This is used b y v ery high lev el languages or scripting languages. This is v ery
exible but rather time consuming as w e need to lo ok up the v alue asso ciated with the v ariable
name ev ery time w e wish to access the v ariable.
